            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Beſides we have had too often and manifeſt experience that there are ſuch in the World who hold a correſpondence with Hell, and that ſome have been Teachers and Inſtructers of others in thoſe curſed Ceremonies for maintaining commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Devil, ſeveral Books having been writ to that purpoſe wherein too many of thoſe horrid abominations are ſet down; Yea it is a certain truth that ſome have diſcourſt in ſeveral Languages, and reaſoned notably about ſciences which they never learned; They have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed ſecrets, diſcovered hidden Treaſures, and told whither ſtoln goods have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed and by whom; They have cauſed brate creatures, yea marble Statues to ſpeak and give rational anſwers, (as the <hi>Jews Teraphim</hi> often did,) and ſure ſuch things as theſe cannot be done by the help of meer natural cauſes, and it muſt needs be that the practicers of them are confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with <hi>Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There have likewiſe been many in the World, who have upon conviction confeſſed themſelves guilty of Familiarity with the Devil; of which we have a multitude of inſtances in divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and many in the following Relations, and it is a very vain ſhift for thoſe who are Patrons for Witches to ſham off this Argument by ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe Confeſſions proceed from the deluded
<pb facs="tcp:153159:7"/>imaginations of mad and melancholy People; Some of them being as free from diſtemperature in their Brains as their Neighbours though it cannot be denied but others have accuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of what they were never guilty, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded fancies having cauſed them to imagine they have really done thoſe things that were never acted but in their own imaginations; But yet that perſons whoſe Judgment and Reaſon has been free from diſturbance by any diſeaſe ſhould not only acknowledg their curſed confederacy with Satan, and mention the particulers, yea give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular demonſtration of the truth thereof by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Marks, Teats, and other Signs made by the Devil upon their bodys and that when examined apart ſeveral ſhould agree in the ſame circumſtances of their Relations, and yet all this ſhould be the meer effect of Melancholy or Phrenſy, cannot without violence to reaſon and common ſenſe be imagined; And as there are Witches ſo they are many times the Cauſes of thoſe ſtrange diſturbances which are in houſes haunted by Evil Spirits of which you have here many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>It has been objected, That reputed Witches are generally poor miſerable Creatures, and that if the Devil would do ſuch wonderful things at their command, it is a wonder they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to fetch them money; To this may be replyed; That certainly the Devil does delude theſe people with the enjoyment of all ſorts of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb facs="tcp:153159:8"/>which they deſire, if not really yet in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which to them is the ſame thing; Now riches not being deſireable but only as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to a pleaſant life, if they can obtain this without them, what occaſion have they for Money; Further they being Perſons of baſe dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Spirits, who deſire nothing ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, miſchief and ſatisfying their filthy luſts, and coming as near as poſſible themſelves to the nature of Devils, ſuch a mean way of living may be more ſuitable to their temper, or they may chuſe it to avoid ſuſpition, and to have the greater free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to practice their wicked Arts.</p>
            <p>It is further ſaid that the opinion of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft is irrational ſince we can hardly imagine that the Devil being ſo full of malice and hatred againſt men ſhould ſuffer any to live when he can ſo eaſily deſtroy them at the command of a Witch; To this I reply that the Devil cannot go beyond his Commiſſion, and it is in Gods power to ſtop his malice when and where he pleaſes, beſides it is very probable that the Laws of the Devils Kingdom do not allow them that freedom, ſince hereby their intereſt would not be carried on which is the ruin of mens Souls, not the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their bodys, to which cunning and fly temptations are more advantagious than open violence, for if men ſhould be thus ſenſible of his malicious practices they might find themſelves too weak to reſiſt, and would therefore run to God for ſuccour, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is moſt certain that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:153159:8"/>Devils nor Witches can hurt us without Gods permiſſion.</p>
            <p>And they that ſay, <hi>It is a wicked and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Opinion to ſay that God permits and ſuffers ſuch things;</hi> It may then be ſaid to be as impious to affirm that God ſuffers us to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſin, yet we are certain he cannot do it without Gods permiſſion as appears by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of St. Paul, <hi>He will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what you are able,</hi> &amp;c. So if we acknowledge that God is omnipotent we muſt confeſs that no wickedneſs could be done in the World without his permiſſion ſeeing it is in his power to prevent it, and there is no impiety in affirming that though God of his great mercy may preſerve any man from falling into ſin, yet he is not bound to do it, as we ſee by dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and if we grant he ſuffers men to ſin why may not he permit Witchcraft? If God ſuffers one man to murther another, why may not he permit Witches to do the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>There is another objection as malicious as fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, That if Witches can do ſuch wonderful feats no man can by the light of reaſon diſcover whether our Saviours Miracles are true or not; But let ſuch conſider the vaſt difference between thoſe wonderful works done by the Holy Jeſus and the Impoſtures of Witches, and their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ends, and likewiſe his exemplary life and converſation, and the wickedneſs of Impoſtors, and remember what our Saviour himſelf ſaith;
<pb facs="tcp:153159:9"/>
               <hi>You ſhall know the Tree by its fruits; Can one gather grapes of thorns or figs of thiſtles?</hi> And when they have ſeriouſly thought thereof, this objection would be anſwered, For could any of theſe Pretenders and vile Wretches infallibly cure all diſeaſes by a word of their mouth, or a touch of their hand? Could they raiſe the dead after being buried ſo long as to ſtink in their graves? Could they feed five thouſand with five loaves and two fiſhes? Did the Earth tremble or the Sun grow dark at any of their deaths? were the graves opened, or did any ever ariſe as he in three days and at laſt gloriouſly aſcend up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in ſight of many witneſſes?</p>
            <p>Methinks the manner of our Saviours birth is enough to ſatisfy us herein, That he was born of a Virgin; A glorioas Star appeared over the place, A company of Heavenly Angels were ſent to proclaim it, as tydings of joy to the whole World, and that the wiſe Men who had ſeen the Star in the Eaſt came ſo far to worſhip and bring him preſents; Add to theſe, the ſweetneſs of his diſpoſition, the ſincerity of his Doctrine, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his life, his tranſcendent knowledge, and Zeal for the glory of God and the ſalvation of men, and certainly theſe are infallible Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to prove he was no Deceiver; So that if whatever has been aſcribed to Witches as miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous were true, or more than has been believed of them, yet we have not the leaſt reaſon to doubt of our bleſſed Saviours Divinity, who himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:153159:9"/>has told us, <hi>That falſe Chriſts ſhall come with ſigns and wonders able to deceive if poſſible the very Elect,</hi> which may convince, us that many wonderful actions may be done without a Divine Commiſſion which may ſeem to be acted by a Divine power, but doubtleſs his Faith is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded, and he is in a very deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that from thence concludes any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Saviour of Mankind, and the Son of God bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Laſtly as to Apparitions, That Spirits have ſometimes really as well as imaginarily appeared to Mortals in the World is amongſt ſober men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond controverſy, and that ſuch things were of old taken notice of we may rationally conclude from St. <hi>Luke 24.37.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>The Diſciples were terrified and affrighted, and ſuppoſed they had ſeen a Spirit;</hi> And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable that ſuch frightful Specters do moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhew themſelves in places where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is not preached, and therefore the Daemons did generally infeſt the Gentiles and Heathens of old, as alſo the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> of latter times, of which we have many inſtances related by credible Hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>It would be both tedious and impertinent to anſwer all that witty men may object againſt the truth of the moſt obvious Opinion, and therefore I ſhall ſay no more in confutation of the common quarrels raiſed by ſuch Perſons upon this ſubject, but only add, That having already publiſhed
<pb facs="tcp:153159:10"/>ſomewhat of this kind in a Book called <hi>Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prodigies of Judgment and Mercy;</hi> And in another intituled <hi>Extraordinary Adventures, Diſcoveries and Events,</hi> with ſome few in <hi>The Hiſtory of the Kingdoms of</hi> Scotland and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the general acceptance they have found hath incouraged me to preſent the Reader with another Collection of Ancient and Modern Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys concerning Spirits, Witches and Apparitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I doubt not will meet with as much favour as the former.</p>

               <p>Another time an iron hook which hung on a nail violently flew up and down, alſo a Chair flew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and at laſt fell on the Table where Victuals ſtood ready to eat, and was like to ſpoil all had they not nimbly ſaved ſome of the Meat with the loſs of the reſt, and the overturning of the Table. The People were ſometimes barricado'd out of doors, when there was no body to do it; and a Cheſt was removed from one place to another, no hand touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Three Keys being tyed together one was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the reſt, and the other two ſlew about making a great noiſe by ſtriking againſt each other. But the greateſt part of the Devils feats were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, though herein he was ſometimes antick enough; wherein the chief ſufferers were the man, and his wife, and grandſon, the man eſpecially had a ſhare in theſe Diabolical Moleſtations. Sometimes they could not eat their Suppers quietly, but had the aſhes on the hearth before their eyes thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Victuals, and upon their heads and cloths, ſo that they were forced up into their Chambers, but had no reſt there, for one of the mans ſhoes being left below, was filled with coals and aſhes, and thrown up after them; Their light was beaten out, and they being laid in their bed with their little Boy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153159:12"/>between them, a great ſtone from the floor of the loft weighing about three pound was thrown upon the mans ſtomach, and he turning it down on the floor, it was again thrown upon him; A box and a board were likewiſe thrown upon them all, and a bag of hops were taken out of their Cheſt, wherewith they were beaten till ſome of the hops were ſcattered on the floor, where the bag was then laid and left.</p>
               <p>Another evening when they ſate by the fire the aſhes were ſo whirl'd at them that they could neither eat their meat nor endure the houſe; A Peel ſtruck the man in the face, an apron hanging by the fire was flung into it, and ſinged before they could ſnatch it off. The man being at Prayers with his Family a broom gave him a blow on his head behind, and fell down before his face. Another day when they were winnowing barley ſome hard dirt was thrown in, hitting the man on the head, and both the man and wife on the back, and when they had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves clean they tryed to fill their half buſhel, but the foul corn was in ſpite of them often caſt among the clean, and the man being divers times thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed was forced to give over what he was about. <hi>Jan.</hi> 23. In particular he had an Iron pin thrown at him twice, his Inkhorn was taken away while he was writing, and when by all his ſearch he could not find it, at laſt he ſaw it drop out of the air down by the fire; A piece of leather was twice thrown at him, and a ſhoe was laid upon his ſhoulder which he catching at, was ſuddenly ſnatcht from him; An handful of Aſhes were thrown in his Face and Cloths, and the Shoe was then clapt on his Head, upon which he clapt his hand holding it ſo faſt that ſomewhat unſeen pulled him with it backward on the floor.</p>
               <p>Next night as they were going to bed a loſt ladder was thrown againſt the door and their light put out, and when the man was abed he was beaten with a heavy pair of leather Breeches, plucked by the hair of his head and beard, pinched, ſcratcht, and his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153159:12"/>bed-board taken from him; Yet more, next night when in bed his bed-board riſe out of its place though he uſed all his ſtrength to keep it in, one of his bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins were brought out of the next room into his bed and did prick him, the cloths wherewith he hoped to ſave his head from blows were violently plucked from thence; A night or two after the man and his wife both received a blow upon their heads, but it was ſo dark they could not ſee the ſtone that gave it, the man had his cap pluckt off his head while he ſate by the fire. The night following they went to bed with their cloths on becauſe of their late diſturbances, and the man, wife, and boy preſently felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pricked, and upon ſearch found in the bed a bodkin, knitting-needle and two ſticks ſharp at both ends. He likewiſe received a great blow on his thigh, and on his face which fetcht bloud, and while he was writing a Candleſtick was twice thrown at him, and a great peice of Bark feircely ſmote him, and a pail of water was poured out without hands. <hi>Jan.</hi> 28. Frozen clods of Cow dung were divers times thrown at the man out of the houſe in which they were; His wife went to milk the Cow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a blow on her head, and ſitting down to her milking work had divers times Cow dung thrown into her pail; The man tryed to ſave the milk by holding a Piggin ſideways under the Cows belly, but yet the dung would fly in and the milk was made only fit for Hogs; That night aſhes were thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the broth provided for ſupper ſo as they could not eat it; Aſhes were likewiſe often thrown into the mans eyes as he ſate by the fire, and an iron Hammer flying at him gave him a great blow on the back; The woman going into the Cellar for beer a great iron peel flew and fell after her through the Trap-door of the Cellar, and going thither again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward upon the ſame account, the door was ſhut down upon her, and the Table came of it ſelf and lay upon the door, which the man was forced to remove
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153159:13"/>ere his wife could be releaſed; Next day while he was writing a diſh went out of its place, leapt into the pail and threw out water upon the man, his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Table, ſo that he could not proceed; his Cap jumpt off his head, and on again, and the pot-lid leapt off from the pot into the kettle on the fire.</p>

                  <hi>Feburary</hi> 2. While he and his Boy were eating cheeſe it was ſnatcht from them and after found under an Apron and a pair of Breeches on the Table; Alſo from the fire roſe little ſticks and aſhes which flying on the man and his boy made them in a dirty pickle.</p>
               <p>But as for the Boy now ſpoken of, much muſt be ſaid concerning him as a principal ſufferer in theſe afflictions; For <hi>December</hi> 18. He ſitting by his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father was hurried into great motions, and the man thereupon took him and made him ſtand between his legs, but the Chair danced up and down, and had like to have caſt both man and boy into the fire, and the Child was after flung about in ſuch a manner as they feared his brains would have been beaten out; In the evening he was again toſſed as before, and the man endeavoured to hold him, but in vain. The Lad was ſoon put to bed, and they heard an huge noiſe, and demanded what was the matter, he anſwered that his Bedſtead leaped up and down; The man and his wife went up and found all quiet, but had not been there long when they ſaw the board by his bed trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and the bed-cloths flying off him, which they immediately put on, and were as ſoon off again, ſo for quietneſs they took him out of his bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dec.</hi> 29. The Boy was violently thrown to and fro; they carried him to the houſe of a Doctor in the Town and there he was free from diſturbance, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home at night his former trouble began, and the man taking him by the hand they were both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thruſt into the fire. They put him to bed, where the cloths were again pluckt off him, the bed-board ſhook, and there were the ſame dreadful noiſes as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153159:13"/>before; They took him up deſigning to ſit by the fire, but the doors clattered, and the chair was thrown at him; Therefore they carried him to the Doctors houſe and that night all was well; Next morning he came home quiet, but as they were doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what he cried out he was prickt on the back, they lookt and found a three grained fork ſticking ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there; which being carried to the Doctors, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid it was his, and the Doctors Servant affirmed the Fork was ſeen at home after the boy was gone; The Boys vexations continuing, they left him at the Doctors, where he was free ſome time, and then again complained he was pricked, upon ſearch they found an Iron Spindle ſticking below his back, he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was prickt ſtill, they look further and found pins in a paper ſticking to his Skin, he once more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of his back, and they diſcovered a long iron, a boul of a Spoon and a peice of a panſheard, they lay down by him on the bed, with the light burning, but he was twice thrown from them, and the ſecond time quite out of the bed, in the morning the bed was toſſed about with ſuch a creaking noiſe as was heard by the Neighbours; In the afternoon ſeveral Knives were one after another brought and put into his back, but pulled out by the Spectators; Only one knife which was miſſing ſeemed to the ſtanders by to come out of his mouth; He was bid to read, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his book was taken and thrown about ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, and at laſt hit the boys grandmother on the head; Another time he was thruſt out of his Chair and rolled up and down with loud outcryes heard that all was one fire, yea he was three times dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly thrown into the fire and very hardly preſerv'd by his friends. The boy likewiſe for a long while together made a noiſe like a Dog, and ſometimes like a Hen with her Chickens, and could not ſpeak ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally.</p>
               <p>Particularly <hi>Decemb.</hi> 26. He barkt like a Dog and clockt like a Hen, and after long ſtraining to ſpeak
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153159:14"/>ſaid, <hi>There's</hi> Powel <hi>I am pinched;</hi> His Tongue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hung out of his mouth, and could by no means be forc't in till his fit was over, and then he ſaid, <hi>It was forc't out by</hi> Powel. He and the houſe alſo had reſt after this till <hi>Jan.</hi> 9. When the Child becauſe of his intolerable ravings lying between the man and his wife, was pulled out of the bed, and thrown with amazing and dangerous force againſt the bedſtead boards. In the day time he was carried beyond all poſſibility of finding him; His Grandmother at laſt ſaw him creeping on one ſide, and dragged him in, where he lay miſerable lame, but recovering his ſpeech he ſaid, <hi>He was carried above the Doctors houſe, and that</hi> Powel <hi>carried him, and then had him into a barn throwing him againſt the Cart-wheel there, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thruſting him out at a hole.</hi> And accordingly they found ſome of the threſhold barley hanging on his cloths.</p>
               <p>Another time falling into a ſwoon, they forced ſomewhat into his mouth for refreſhment, but it was turned out as faſt as they put it in, ere long he came to himſelf, and ſeem'd willing to eat, but the meat would forcibly fly out of his mouth, and when he was able to ſpeak he ſaid, Powel <hi>would not let him eat;</hi> Having obſerved the Boy to be beſt at a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houſe, the man carried him to his daughter three miles off; The Boy was very antick as he was going, but at length made a grievous hallowing, and when he came thither, he threw a great ſtone at the maid of the houſe, and fell to eating aſhes. Being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at home, they had reſt a while, but <hi>Jan.</hi> 19. In the morning he ſwooned and coming to himſelf roared terribly, and eat aſhes, ſticks, and rug yarn. Next morning there was ſuch a dreadful racket with the boy that the man and his wife took him to bed to them, whereupon a bedſtaf was thrown at them, and a Chamber-pot with its contents poured upon them, and they were ſeverely pinched; The man being about to riſe his cloths were divers times pluckt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153159:14"/>from him, himſelf thruſt out of the bed, and his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thrown after him. The Lad likewiſe had his cloths oft pluckt off him in theſe winter nights, and was wofully diſturbed with theſe malicious devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tricks till it pleaſed God to reſtrain the wicked Daemon.</p>
               <p>All this while the Devil did not uſe to appear in any viſible Shape, only they would think they had hold of the hand that ſcratched them, but it would give them the ſlip, and once the man was diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beaten by a fiſt, and an hand got hold of his wriſt which he ſaw, but could not catch, and the likeneſs of a Blackmore Child appeared from under the Rug and Blanket where the man lay, and it would riſe up, fall down, nod and ſlip under the cloths when they endeavoured to claſp it, never ſpeaking any thing. Neither were many words ſpoken by Satan all this time, only once having put out their light they heard a ſcraping on the boards, and then a pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drumming on them, which was followed with a voice finging <hi>Revenge, Revenge, Sweet is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;</hi> Who being much terrified thereat called earneſtly upon God, the iſſue of which was, that ſuddenly with a mournful note there were ſix times over uttered ſuch expreſſions. <hi>Alas! Alas! Me knock no more, me knock no more,</hi> and now all ceaſed. <hi>William Morſe</hi> does further affirm that a Seaman being a Mate of a Ship coming often to viſit him told him, <hi>That they wronged his wife who ſuſpected her to be guilty of Witchcraft, and that the Boy his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child was the cauſe of this trouble, and if he would let him have the Boy one day he would warrant him his houſe ſhould be no more troubled;</hi> To which he conſented, and next morning betimes the Mate came, and the Boy was with him till night, after which his houſe he ſaith was not for ſome time moleſted with Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>Thus far is the Relation of this Daemon, but the true reaſon of this diſturbance is not yet certainly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153159:15"/>known, ſome as was ſaid, ſuſpected <hi>Morſes</hi> Wife to be guilty of Witchraft. One of the Neighbours took apples which were brought out of the houſe and put them into the fire upon which their own houſes were much diſturb'd. Another Neighbour cauſed an horſhoe to be nailed before the doors, and as long as it remained ſo, they could not perſwade the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Perſon to go into the houſe, but when the horſhoe was gone ſhe preſently viſited them; The vanity and ſuperſtition of theſe experiments deſerves to be expoſed, ſince the Daemons whom the blind Gentiles of old worſhipped told their Servants that ſuch things as theſe would very much affect them, yea and that certain Characters, Signs, and Charms would render their Power ineffectual, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they would become ſubject when their own directions were obeyed. It is ſport to the Devils to ſee ſilly men thus deluded and made fools of by them Others ſuſpected that one <hi>Powel</hi> a Seaman who was thought to be a Conjurer ſet the Devil on work thus to diſquiet <hi>Morſes</hi> family, or it may be ſome other thing yet reſerved in the ſecrets of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might be the true Original of all this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Eſſay of Provid. p.</hi> 142.</p>

               <p>The reaſon that <hi>Ann Styles</hi> deſigned to go to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was, that her Miſtreſs having faſly accuſed the two young Gentlewomen of deſign to poyſon her, they to clear themſelves went to all the Apothecarys ſhops in <hi>Salisbury</hi> to inquire who had lately ſold any Arſnich, and found that this very maid had been imployed by her Miſtreſs to buy an ounce and an half, and to put it under Mrs. <hi>Sarahs</hi> bed thereby to raiſe ſuſpition of ſome evil intent in them againſt her; Having made this diſcovery her Miſtreſs perſuaded the maid to go ſhift for her ſelf and prevent the trouble and diſgrace of being brought before a Juſtice, when ſhe was gone, ſome having notice ſhe was run away, purſued and overtook her near <hi>Sutton</hi> as the Witch foretold, and carrying her into an Inn ſhe freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed what hath been related, and giving them the peice of money and the two pins, ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould be troubled for not keeping theſe things ſecret, the Devil having forewarned her of it, and accordingly ſoon after being committed to <hi>Sarum</hi> Jayl, ſhe fell into deſperate Fits and Agonies ſo that ſix men could not hold her, and once ſhe was caught up ſo high that her feet touched their breaſts; Another time being miſerably tormented about midnight ſhe cryed out, <hi>The Devil will carry me away,</hi> and was thereupon pull'd from them that held her, and thrown from the low bed where ſhe lay to the top of an high bed, with her cloths torn off her back and a peice of her skin torn away. The candle on the table was thrown down and put out, at which time there being a little Boy almoſt aſleep he was waked and ſo affrighted at the noiſe that he had no power to go out of the room with the reſt, but ſtayed there and ſaw a ſpirit like a great black man without a head ſcuffling with the Maid, who took and ſet her in a chair, and told her; <hi>She muſt go with him, he was come for her ſoul which ſhe had given him;</hi> The Maid anſwered, <hi>Her ſoul was none of her own to give, and though he had already got her bloud, yet her ſoul he ſhould never have,</hi> and after
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:153159:18"/>tumbling and throwing her about awhile he diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Now what the Boy heard and ſaw could be no fancy but a real object, eſpecially conſidering the condition of <hi>Ann Bodenham</hi> the Witch at that time, who being apprehended upon the Maids infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and committed to the ſame Priſon, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chamber was ſeen at that inſtant with her cloths off in her chains running about like mad, and being askt the reaſon replied; <hi>She could not keep her bed but was pulled out by viclence, and pray,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>what's the matter in the Maids Chamber?</hi> Nothing ſaid they but a child is not well; <hi>Do not you lie to me,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I know what is the matter as well as your ſelves?</hi>

               <p>After this the Maid not having taken any reſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days nor nights, and being under moſt grievous hurryings &amp; tortures of body, the Witch was brought into the room utterly unknown to her, but had no ſooner ſet her foot within it when the Maid gave a moſt hideous glance with her eyes and preſently ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

She alſo acknowledged ſhe had a book of Charms whereby ſhe raiſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which was worth thouſands of other books, and that there was a particular charm in it for finding a hidden Treaſure. She affirmed ſhe was ſure there were Spirits to be raiſed and that there was no hurt in them ſince they would keep people from harm. At the Jayl and before the Judges ſhe was ſearcht and there was found on her ſhoulder a certain Mark or Yeat about the bigneſs of a womans nipple hollow and ſoft with a hole in the top. The Powder afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned was likewiſe ſhown there, with the peice of money that the Spirit bit, and the Witch gave to the Maid; The hole alſo in the Maids finger was then ſhown out of which the bloud was ſqueezed; It was obſerved that when the Maid recovered out of her Fits the Spectators ſaw a black ſhade come from her, whereupon ſhe preſently came to her ſelf.</p>

               <p>A Worthy Divine then preſent told the Recorder that he had often pray'd with the Maid, and when he concluded with the Lords Prayer as ſoon as he pronounced that Petition <hi>but deliver us from evil,</hi> the Maid was toſt and ſhaken as a Maſtiff Dog worries a little one; Then the Recorder bid the Witch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the Lords Prayer which ſhe did till ſhe came to thoſe words, <hi>but deliver us from evil,</hi> which ſhe skipt over, and would by no means be brought to ſay; Then they bid her ſay the Creed which ſhe did till ſhe came to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> but would by no means be brought to confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt was our Lord; The Miniſter told the Recorder that when the Maid was in theſe dead ſenſeleſs Fits if the Witch did but lay her hand upon her ſhe was toſt and thrown toward her; Who thereupon cauſed her to be taken up and laid upon a bed cloſe covered eſpecially her head and face becauſe ſhe ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear nor ſee; Then he made ſigns to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſtand round about the bed, and that the Witch ſhould ſtand among them, and that every one ſhould ſoftly lay their hand on her which they did, and the Maid did not ſtir till the Witch laid her hand upon her, for then all the cloths were thrown off, and the Maid toſſed toward her; Whereupon the Recorder looking upon the Witch ſaid, <hi>Lord have mercy upon thee Woman</hi> and ſent her back to <hi>Newgate;</hi> As ſoon as ſhe was gone the voice that came out of the Maids noſtrils ceaſed, and ſhe came to her ſelf, and went home to her Mother.</p>

               <p>About three weeks or a month after the Witch was condemn'd the Maid continued every ſecond day in moſt ſtrange and dreadful Fits and Torments. Whereupon ſeveral Miniſters and other Chriſtians met together to pray for her; when on a ſudden after a terrible conflict, which ſo much amazed ſome that they cried out with a confuſed noiſe, <hi>Jeſus help, Jeſus ſave,</hi> the Maid ſtarted up out of a wicker Chair wherein ſhe ſate, and by main ſtrength lifted up one of the Miniſters with her who kneeled behind and held her in his Arms, and threw white froth out of her throat and mouth round about the Chamber, and on a ſudden fell down into the Chair as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dead, with her head hanging on one ſide, her neck and arms limber though before as ſtiff as if frozen; preſently after life returned into her whole body, and her eyes and tongue came into their right place; She then looked up with a cheerful countenance round the Chamber, and with a loud voice ſpoke ſaying, <hi>O he is come, he is come; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter is come, the Comforter is come; I am delivered, I am delivered.</hi> Her Father hearing theſe words wept for joy, and with a faultring voice ſaid, <hi>O theſe were her Grandfathers words</hi> who ſuffered in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days. She then kneeled down, and gave humble and hearty thanks and praiſe to God for he deliverance, which ſhe continued to do till her voice grew weak, and the Miniſter deſired her to forbear, and ſo they ended the day with Thankſgiving.

Who relates that in <hi>June</hi> 1682. the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> heard a voice at the door of her dwelling ſaying, <hi>What do you here?</hi> About an hour after ſtanding at the door ſhe had a blow on her eye that ſtruck her head againſt the door poſt, and two or three days after a ſtone, as ſhe judged about a pound weight, was thrown along within the houſe into the Chimney, and going to take it up it was gone, all the Family were in the houſe and no hand appearing which might be inſtrumental in throwing the ſtone. About two hours after a Frying-pan then
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:153159:22"/>hanging in the Chimney was heard to ring ſo loud that not only thoſe in the houſe heard it, but others alſo that lived on the other ſide of the River above an hundred rods diſtant; Whereupon ſhe and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band going in a Canoo over the River, they ſaw ſomething like the head of a man new ſhaved, and the tail of a white Cat about three foot diſtance from each other ſwimming over before the Canoo, but no body appeared to join head and tail together, and they returning over the River in leſs than an hour the ſame Apparition followed them back again, and diſappeared at their Landing. A day or two after the woman was ſtruck on the head as ſhe judged with a ſtone, which made it ſwell and very ſore; She was then in the yard, and going inſtantly into her houſe ſhe was bitten black and blew on both arms, and one of her breaſts ſcratched, the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Teeth being like thoſe of a man were ſeen by many, whereupon leaving their houſe to ſojourn at a Neighbours on the other ſide the River there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> in that other houſe a Woman in a green ſafeguard, a ſhort blue cloak, and a white Cap making an offer to ſtrike her with a fireband but did not touch her; The day following the ſame ſhape appeared again to her, but now clothed with a gray gown, white apron, and white head-cloths, and ſeemed to laugh ſeveral times but no voice heard; Since when this <hi>Mary</hi> hath been freed from theſe Satanical moleſtations; But her husband and ſhe being returned in <hi>March</hi> after with their Family to dwell again in their houſe, <hi>Antonio</hi> on his entrance into it hearing the noiſe of a man walking in his Chamber, and ſeeing the Boards bend under him as he walked though no man to be ſeen in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for they went on purpoſe to look, he returned with his Family to dwell on the other ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet planting his ground though he forſook his houſe; He hath had five rods of good log fence, or pales thrown down at once, and the appearance of

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153159:23"/>of theſe markt ſtones were found flying about again, and thus it continued about four hours that night; The Gentleman then went to bed, but a ſtone came and threw open his Chamber door, which was only put to and not lockt, a brick was alſo ſent on the ſame errand; The ſtone that came in the Gentleman lockt up in his Chamber, but it was fetcht out, and carried with great noiſe into the next room; The Spit was carried up the Chimney, and came down with the point forward and ſtuck in a log on the fire, and being removed by one of the Company to one ſide of the Chimney, was by an unſeen hand thrown out at the window. It thus continued dayly though with ſome ſhort intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and then returned again. The ſtones were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thrown where the Maſter of the houſe was, whether in the field or barn; A black Cat was once ſeen while the ſtones flew, and was ſhot at, but ſhe was too nimble for them; Some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily affirm they once ſaw the appearance of an hand put forth at the Hall Window throwing ſtones toward the Entry, though there was no body in the Hall at that time, ſometimes they ſhould hear a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal hollow whiſtling, otherwhile the noiſe of the trotting of an horſe, and ſnorting, but nothing ſeen.

In the houſe ſuch things happened frequently not only in the night but in the day time if the man himſelf was at home, but never when his wife was at home alone. There was no great violence in their motion, for though ſeveral Perſons in the Family, and others alſo were ſtruck with the things thrown by an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hand, yet they were not hurt thereby; Only the man himſelf had once his arm ſomewhat pained by a blow given him, and at another time bloud was drawn from his leg by a ſcratch he received.

The Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cover the foulneſs of the fact, and that no diſgrace might come upon his widdow gave out that he died of an Apoplexy, and declined all viſits of Friends and Neighbours. In the mean time they got him waſhed, and laid linnens ſo handſomely about him that even they that ſaw him afterward, as the Parſon and ſome others, had not the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition that he died ſuch a death, and ſo he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent burial with a Funeral Sermon, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances becoming one of his rank and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Six weeks had not paſt but ſo ſtrong a rumor broke forth that he died not of any diſeaſe, but laid violent hands upon himſelf, that the Magiſtracy of the place could not but bring all who had ſeen the Corps to a ſtrict examination. They endeavoured at firſt to ſhuffle off the matter, with many fair Apologies in behalf of the deceaſed to remove all ſuſpition of ſo heinous an act, but it being preſſed very home to their conſciences, at laſt they confeſſed he died a violent death, but deſired their favour and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his Widdow and Children who were in no fault, adding alſo; <q>That it was uncertain but he might be ſlain by ſome external accident, or if by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf yet in ſome irreſiſtible fit of frenzy or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

But the Cat was ſuddenly gone and preſently after he breathed his laſt. A fair ſtory was made to the Miniſter of the Pariſh and the Magiſtracy of the Town allowing it he was buried in the Church on the right ſide of the Altar, his Friends paying well for it. No ſooner was <hi>Contius</hi> dead but a great Tempeſt aroſe, which raged moſt at his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral there being ſuch impetuous ſtorms of Wind with ſnow that it made mens bodies quake and their teeth chatter in their heads, but he was no ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerred when of a ſudden all was calm. He had not been dead above a day or two when ſeveral rumors were ſpread in the Town of a Spirit in the ſhape of <hi>Contius</hi> that would have raviſhed a Woman; This happened before he was buried. After his burial the ſame Spectre awakened one that was ſleeping in his Dining Room, ſaying, <hi>I can ſcarce withhold my ſelf

               <p>A Maid-ſervant of one of the Citizens of <hi>Pentſch</hi> (while theſe Tragedies &amp; ſtirs were ſo frequent in the Town) heard, together with ſome others lying in their beds the noiſe and tramplings of one riding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the houſe, who at laſt ran againſt the Walls with that violence that the whole houſe ſhook again as if it would fall, and the Windows were all filled with flaſhings of Light. The Maſter of the Houſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of it went out of doors in the morning to ſee what the mattter was, and he beheld in the ſnow the impreſſions of ſtrange feet, neither like Cows, Horſes, Hogs or any creature he knew. Another time about eleven at night <hi>Contius</hi> appears to one of his Friends that was a witneſs to a Child of his, ſpeaks to him, and bids him be of good courage, for he came only to impart to him a matter of great importance; <q>I have left behind me, ſaid he, my youngeſt Son <hi>James</hi> to whom you are Godfather. Now there is at my eldeſt Son <hi>Stevens</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Jegerdorf</hi> a certain cheſt wherein I have put four hundred and fifteen Florins; This I tell you that your Godſon may not be defrauded of any of them, and it is your duty to look after it, and if you neglect it woe be to you.</q> Having ſaid this the Spectre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted and went up into the upper rooms of the Houſe, where he walked ſo furiouſly that all ratled again, and the roof ſwagged with his heavy ſtampings.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:153159:30"/>This <hi>Contius</hi> his friend told the Parſon of the Pariſh a day or two after for a certain truth.</p>
               <p>But there are ſeveral other notorious paſſages of this <hi>Contius;</hi> As his often ſpeaking to the Maid that lay with her Miſtriſs his Widdow, to give him place for it was his right, and threatning if ſhe would not give it him he would writh her neck behind her; His Galloping up and down like a wanton Horſe in the Court of his Houſe; His being divers times ſeen to ride not only in the ſtreets but along the Valleys of the Field and on the Mountains with ſo ſtrong a trot that he made the very ground flaſh with fire under him; His bruiſing the body of a Child of a certain Smiths, and making his very bones ſo ſoft that you might wrap the Corps on heaps like a glove; His miſerable tugging all night with a <hi>Jew</hi> that had taken up his Inn in the Town, and toſſing him up and down in the lodging where he lay; His dreadful accoſting of a Waggoner an old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his while he was buſy in the ſtable, vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out fire againſt him to terrify him, and biting of him ſo cruelly by the foot that he made him lame.</p>
               <p>Yet his moſt ſevere uſage was toward the Parſon of the Pariſh who penned this Narrative, and whom this Fury ſo ſqueezed and preſſed while he was aſleep that awaking he found himſelf abſolutely weak, and his ſtrength quite gone, yet could not imagine the reaſon; Put while he lay conſidering of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Spectre returns again to him, and holding him ſo faſt all over that he could not ſtir a finger, rouled him in the bed divers times together. The ſame happened to his wife another time whom <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> coming through the Caſement in the ſhape of a little Dwarf, and running to her bed-ſide, ſo wrung and pulled as if he would have torn her throat out had not her two daughters come in to help her. He preſſed the lips together of one of the Miniſters Sons ſo that they could ſcarce get them aſunder; His Houſe was ſo generally diſturbed with this unruly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153159:31"/>Ghoſt that the ſervants were fain to keep together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights in one room, lying upon ſtraw and watching the approaches of this troubleſom Fiend; But a Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another time he came into her Maſters Chamber making a noiſe like a Hog that eats grains, ſmacking and grunting very loud; They could not chaſe him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by ſpeaking to him, but ever as they lighted a Candle he vaniſhed. Another time about evening while this Divine was ſitting with his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren about him, exerciſing himſelf in Muſick accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his uſual manner, a moſt grievous ſtink aroſe ſuddenly which by degrees ſpread about the room; Hereupon he commends himſelf and his Family to God by prayer; The ſmell nevertheleſs increaſed, and became above all meaſure peſtilently noiſom, ſo that he was forced to go up into his Chamber; He and his Wife had not been in bed above a quarter of an hour but they find the ſame ſtink in the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber of which while they were complaining to each other out ſteps <hi>Contius</hi> his Ghoſt from the Wall, and creeping to his bed-ſide breaths upon him an exceeding cold breath of ſo intolerable ſtinking and malignant a ſcent as is beyond all imagination and expreſſion; Hereupon the good Miniſter grew very ill and kept his bed, his face, belly and guts ſwelling as if poiſoned; Whence he was likewiſe troubled with a difficulty of breathing and with a putrid infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his eyes, ſo that he could not well uſe them long after.</p>
               <p>Many other Feats were performed by this Spectre which if related would exceed what are already ſet down, As the trembling and ſweating of <hi>Contius</hi> his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153159:31"/>Gelding from which he was neither free night nor day; The burning blue of the Candles at the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Contius</hi> his Ghoſt; His drinking up the milk in the milk bowls, flinging dung into them, and turning the milk into bloud; His pulling up poſts deep ſet in the ground and ſo heavy that two luſty Porters could not deal with them; His diſcourſing with ſeveral men he met concerning the affairs of the Waggoners; His ſtrangling of old men; His holding faſt the Cradles of Children, or taking them out of them; His frequent endeavouring to force Women; His defiling the Water in the Font, and fouling the cloth of the Altar on that ſide which hung toward his Grave with dirty bloudy ſpots; His catching up Dogs in the Streets and knocking out their Brains againſt the ground; His ſucking dry the Cows, and tying their tails like the tail of an Horſe; His devouring of Poultry, and his flinging of Goats bound into the Racks; His tying an Horſe to an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Out Tub in the Stable to clatter up and down with it, and tying the hinder foot of another to his own headſtall; His looking out at the Window of a low Tower, and then ſuddenly changing himſelf into the form of a long ſtaff; His chiding of a Woman for ſuffering her ſervant to waſh diſhes on a Thurſday, at what time he laid his hand upon her, and ſhe ſaid it felt colder than Ice; His throwing clods at one of the Women that waſht his Corps with ſuch violence that the prints of the clods were ſeen on the wall; His attempting to raviſh another, who excuſing her ſelf ſaid, <hi>My</hi> Contius <hi>thou ſeeſt how old, wrinkled and deformed I am, and how unfit for thoſe kind of Sports,</hi> at which he ſet up a loud laughter and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>

               <p>His body being brought to the fire proved as unwilling to be burnt as before to be drawn, ſo that the Hangman was forc't with hooks to pull him out, and cut him into pieces to make him burn, which while it was doing the bloud was found ſo pure and ſpirituous that it ſpurted into his face as he cut him, but at laſt with the expence of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixteen great Billets all was turned into aſhes, which being carefully ſwept together, as in the foregoing relation, and thrown into the River this turbulent Ghoſt never appeared more.

               <p>NOT far from <hi>Torga</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> a Nobleman walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Feilds to refreſh himſelf met one in the habit of a Gentleman but was really a Daemon, who complementing him told him he was out of imployment and would very gladly ſerve him; Who thinking him fit for his buſineſs receives him into his ſervice, and makes him Maſter of his Horſe; This Nobleman was a very impious Perſon, and lived chiefly by robbery and plundering Paſſengers, and had now got a Servant very fit for his purpoſe. One time when he was going a Journey, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended one of his Horſes to his ſpecial care in his abſence, the Maſter being gone this excellent Servant
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:153159:41"/>conveighs the Horſe up into a very high Tower, a his return the Horſe hearing his Maſters voice put
<figure/> his head out of the battlements of the Tower neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud, The Maſter much wonders and asks who it was that carried up his Horſe thither, the good ſervant anſwers, It was he that had ſo carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Maſters commands, and knew no place ſafor for him than there, where he could neither run away nor be ſtoln; but yet pretended he could not ſo eaſily fetch him down as he carried him up, ſo that they were conſtrained to let down the Horſe from the Tower with ropes; It happened afterward that thoſe whom this Nobleman had plundred pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him in order to bring him to juſtice for his crimes, when this ſervant cryes out, <hi>Maſter make your eſcape,</hi> and preſently pulls ſomething out of his budget whereby he ſtopt the courſe of the Horſes that followed him, and he thereby got away; At length he was taken, and thrown into Priſon, where he implores his Servants aſſiſtance who appears and tells him that being faſt bound in fetters he could not now free him; The Maſter is very urgent and at laſt his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:153159:41"/>Servant tells him he will do his endeavour therein, but ſays he, if I ſet you at liberty it ſhall be upon condition that you ſtir not your hands, nor make any ſigns of defence; Whereupon the Evil Spirit brings him out of the Priſon with his chains and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on, and carries him a great height into the Air, who being amazed and afraid cryed out, <hi>O Eternal God whither am I going?</hi> Hereupon the Devil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately caſts him down into a watry marſhy place, and then haſtning home to his wife, bids her go and help out her husband who was ſtuck faſt in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN the City of <hi>Athens</hi> there was a very handſome houſe which no body would take nor dwell in, becauſe it had the report of being haunted, and that in the night there was a Spirit walked in it drawing a Chain, and making a noiſe ſeeming ſometimes afar off, and otherwhile very near. After which there would appear a great old man, with his fleſh worn away, having a long beard, his hair ſtanding an end and all tangled, fetters on his feet, and a chain at his hands which he would always be ſhaking. Thoſe that formerly dwelt at the houſe could never reſt quietly in the night, but grew heavy and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and ſoon after fell ſick and died, for in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day time though they ſaw not the Spirit yet were ſo terrified with the thoughts of it that they imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it always in their ſight, and the ringing of the chains ſtill ſounded in their ears, whereby their fear continued without intermiſſion; Upon which the houſe ſtood long empty though bills were put on it, and all other means uſed to induce people to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it. At the ſame time <hi>Athenodorus</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher came to <hi>Athens,</hi> who ſeeing this houſe offered at ſo ſmall a rent, thought there was ſomething in it, and would needs know the Myſtery; when he was informed of the whole matter he was the more
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153159:42"/>deſirous to buy it, and at night took poſſeſſion of it, cauſing a bed to be made for him in one of the Chambers toward the ſtreet, and providing pen, ink, and paper, and a Lamp well lighted, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Servants to withdraw into a back room of the houſe; This done he ſetled himſelf very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to writing and ſtudy, that his mind being imployed he might make the leſs account of what he ſhould hear; About midnight the Spirit begins to ſhake his fetters and his chain, but <hi>Athenodorm</hi> without once moving his head ſate ſtill writing though the noiſe increaſed very much, at length the Spirit comes on, and ſtands at the Chamber door, and then the Philoſopher lifting up his head he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spectre to appear in the ſhape of an old man as is before related; The Spirit made a ſign to him with its finger as if it called him to come to it; The Philoſopher anſwered it with his hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, it ſhould ſtay a little, and ſo fell to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting again, upon which the Ghoſt ſhaking its chain
<figure/> over his head, <hi>Athenodorus</hi> looking up perceived that it made a ſign to him as before, whereupon he took

The Spirit went very pitifully as if it carried its irons with great pain, and going before him out into the ſtreet ſuddenly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away; <hi>Athenodorus</hi> took ſome graſs and leaves and laid them as a mark upon the place, and next morning went to the Council of the City deſiring them to dig and ſearch in that place, which being done they found a dead body all rotten whereof no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remained but the bones that were chained; The bones were taken up and buried, though they knew not whoſe body it was or how it came there, and after that there was never any Spirit ſeen in the Houſe of <hi>Athenodorus.

               <p>IN the Annals of <hi>Bavaria</hi> we find two notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the fury of theſe wicked Daemons. In the year 1533. at <hi>Schiltac</hi> a little City in the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Wirtemburg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> a malicious Spirit having for ſeveral days horribly affrighted and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Inhabitants with dreadful howlings and cryes, and eſpecially the Inn-keeper at the Golden Star and his Family, it was at length diſcovered that a woman-ſervant in that houſe kept intelligence with the Devil; and that he had carnal knowledge of her; Thoſe who were of this opinion, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon very probable conjectures, ordered the ſervant to depart thence into ſome other place.

There dwelt in that village over againſt her a Woman of ill fame among her Neighbours for divers bad practices. This Woman coming to the School-Miſtriſs deſired her to lend her a ſmall peice of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money, which the other refuſed, who ſaid ſhe knew ſhe had ſuch a peice, and it had been better ſhe had lent it her, going away muttering.

When they were gone a very great light like a flaſh of Lightning would ſtrike in at the window, and hang about the walls in heaps of light like fire, paſſing from one room to another for an hour or more at a time, and ſometimes continued all the night long, ſhining through the window into the ſtreet and viſible to the Neighbours, all the while this light continued ſhe was in extremity of miſery, and would oft cry out and name the ſuſpected Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; She continued in this miſerable ſtate about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen years, it happening when ſhe was about forty, and had reduced her ſtreight well proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned body to crookedneſs and deformity. The Phyſicians were all of Opinion that the inward parts of her body were wounded by ſome Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal practice, and adviſed her to remove her habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſhe did, but to no purpoſe, the evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument following her thither alſo, and of many young broods of Chickens which ſhe attempted to nurſe up for many years ſhe could not raiſe one, but they would ſuddenly turn round twiſting their necks ſeveral times about until they dropt down dead. She kept two Cats of her own for which ſhe had a great fancy, but as ſoon as ever the other ſort of Cats entred the room they would fly like Lightning ſometimes into the fire, ſometimes into the Oven, and up the Chimney or any way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the room whilſt they were there, nor did they ever thrive but ſoon after ſtarved and pined away; After her removal, her Son came from <hi>Wincheſter</hi> a ſtrong healthy youth about ſeventeen who had not been there above three months when he was taken with dreadful raving frantick fits ſo that five or ſix men could not hold him, he would ſpring out of their hands, and leap up with his head againſt the cieling, ſometimes he would catch up a Knife or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, and therewith endeavour to cut his own throat
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:153159:46"/>or do himſelf ſome other miſchief roaring out in a moſt terrible manner; <hi>That the Witch aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was by him, and commanded him to do it or elſe ſhe would ſtrangle him, or choke him with pins or the like.</hi> So that they were forc't to lay all dangerous inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of his reach, and yet though he had none of them near him, when his fit came his hands and pockets would be full of Knives, Sizzars, Razors, and the like, and after theſe fits he would caſt out of his mouth a great quantity of pins and needles, and was forced by extream weakneſs to keep his bed ſeveral days. One day as the young man was in the height of his fits his mother ſaw the ſuſpected Party ſcrambling againſt the wall of the room, and immediately called out to her husband, <hi>John, John! There's the Witch,</hi> (naming the Party) <hi>run her through with your Sword.</hi> Upon which he darted his Sword at the place ſhe directed him though he ſaw nothing, and his wife cryed out, <hi>John you have cut the Witch, you have cut her hand,</hi> and it was obſerved that the woman had a lame hand a conſiderable time after. This afflicted woman would often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to Church, but if the other were there ſhe had not power to enter, but ſtay'd in the porch or at the window; The Son continued in thoſe amazing Fits about five years, and then ran away in one of them having never been ſeen nor heard of ſince. The Mother continued in this lamentable ſtate about ſeventeen years, and then died of pain and grief, but very ſenſible, having her reaſon and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laſt. She was of Opinion that others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that woman contributed to her miſery; And though many Phyſicians and Neighbours were Eye and Ear-witneſſes of what is here related, yet I do not underſtand that any Juſtice was applied to for apprehending of the ſuppoſed Witch and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to puniſhment, but that ſhe lived about five years after the afflicted. <hi>Pandem.</hi> p. 189.</p>

After which they danced in a ring backward it may be to prevent their knowing and accuſing one another, if they ſhould happen to be detected; Which this <hi>Triſcillianus</hi> afterward did to <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth King of <hi>France,</hi> relating; <q>That there were many who adored and worſhipped a Goat in their meetings, and kiſſed his Poſteriors, and then they danced, and the Devils had carnal commerce with the women, and with each other in the Shapes of men and women.</q> After their dancing the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were covered and furniſhed with meat; The woman then bid her Husband ſit down with the reſt of the company and ſalute the Prince, which being done, the man not reliſhing his cheer without Salt called for it, which being brought, he cryed out aloud,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:153159:47"/>
                  <hi>God be thanked we have Salt now,</hi> which was no ſooner uttered, but Men, Women, Meat and Tables preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſhed, and the man was left alone in a cold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate place utterly unknown to him; When it was day he met with ſome Shepherds, who informed him that he was in the Earldom of <hi>Beneventum</hi> a great many miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> to which he was forced to travel back and beg food, and cloths in his return. When he came home he accuſed his wife, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached others, and they all confeſſing their guilt were hanged for their enormous wickedneſs. <hi>Hiſt.

               <p>THE ſame Author writes, that being invited by a Nobleman to the Caſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Spoleto;</hi> When he arrived the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gave him an account of three Sage Matrons who were found to be Witches; One of whom truſting in his promiſe that ſhe might freely ſpeak without danger, declared that fifteen years ſince ſhe was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by an Old Woman to an aſſembly of Witches, where the Devil being preſent obliged them by an Oath to renounce God their Creator, their Faith and their Religion, and to be faithful to him, and that with their hands laid upon a book of very ſtrange Characters they were ſworn to perform ſome So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Services to him in the night, and that they muſt go whereſoever he commanded them; The Devil on the other ſide promiſed them mirth, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and felicity forever; She confeſſed further that at that time ſhe killed four men, and many Cattel, and procured much damage to the fruits of the earth, and if it happened that at any time ſhe came not to their meetings except ſhe could ſhew very good cauſe to the contrary ſhe was ſo torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe could neither ſleep nor eat; When ſhe came thither ſhe heard the voice of a man who called the Devil little Lord, and ſometimes Mr. <hi>Martinetus;</hi> As ſoon as ſhe had anointed her
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:153159:48"/>ſelf with a certain unguent, ſhe mounted a Goat that ſtood ready at the door and held faſt by his main and tail, whereby ſhe was conveyed to the great Wood at <hi>Beneventum</hi> where ſhe found a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Witches and Inchanters, when ſhe had there vowed allegiance to the Devil, ſhe danc't, ſat at the Table, and laſt of all every Devil had filthy commerce with her or him whom they had choſen for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and when they had done every one returned back upon their particular Goat or Devil with the ſame incredible ſwiftneſs that they came there, and likewiſe that they did privately worſhip the Devil at home in their own houſes; This confeſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with thoſe of two more, many others were accuſed, who acknowledging their crime, they with their ointments and powders were all burnt together. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 131.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:153159:48"/>and receiving many hurts and wounds; Having at length vanquiſhed and driven them away, the man falls again to his work and preſently 2 Officers ſeize him and carry him before a Judge, who being much moved with fury and rage commands him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly caſt into a dark loathſom dungeon; His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, ſighs and groans nothing availing to clear him, or manifeſt his innocency; The Judges anger increaſed, who exclaimed againſt him as an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fellow in ſo obſtinately denying the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Villany wherewith he was charged. After three days the Judge being continually importuned to execute Juſtice upon him, ſends for him to be brought publickly into the Court of Juſtice there to receive his Sentence in the preſence of the other

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:153159:49"/>ſhe obſerved her to go into the Miniſters back yard toward the ſtable; Some few nights after there was throwing of Stones over the Miniſters houſe, and ſome were flung againſt the Hall door and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; Which were found in the yard next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they fell it was with no great violence; The Miniſter againſt whom the Devils chiefeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice was, coming in one night at the back door, and ſhutting it after him had a great ſtone thrown after him which ſtruck the door very hard and left a mark and impreſſion behind it. This ſhe, (or rather the Devil) did in imitation of a prank ſhe plaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe died; For the Miniſter cauſing his other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to thruſt her out of that very door, ſhe out of anger threw a great ſtone with much violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; The aforementioned <hi>Iſabel Murray</hi> going into the Miniſters houſe one night was hit very hard with a ſtone on her back; The man-ſervant who lookt to the Horſes, as he was going to bed in the Stable was griped by the heel to his great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; He crying out aloud his Miſtriſs and others came to him, and found him in much conſternation and affright; That night ſeveral clods and ſtones were thrown but no perſon touched, only an old Horſe-comb which had been miſſing many years was thrown with much fury at the Lads beds head; The Horſes were found in the morning in great ſweats, and much diſorder, and while this Youth was dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Garden he had ſeveral ſtones thrown at him, but was only ſtruck by one and that very favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and ſeveral noiſes were heard in the Houſe; One night a burning coal was thrown under one of the beds, and one of the family had his Cap taken off in the night which was found next morning in the Chimney full of Cinders and Aſhes. If the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil could have done more he certainly would. This trouble continued eight or nine weeks during which frequent Prayers were ſent up to God, and one ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flingly ſaying, <hi>Now let the Miniſter and his brethren

               <p>But <hi>Iſabel Murray</hi> reports divers other particulars of this Apparition, as that when ſhe ſaw it firſt the face was as black as ſoot, and that ſhe once ſaw her walking in the Garden, and taking up ſomething from the ground, ſaying <hi>a ſtone, a ſtone,</hi> and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great number of ſmall ſtones into her Cap, ſhe threw them down under a buſh, which ſome think were the ſtones that were thrown in the night; The woman took the courage to ſpeak to her, and ſaid, <hi>Hey, what doſt thou do here</hi> Iſabel Heriot, <hi>I charge thee by the Law thou lives on to tell me;</hi> The Spectre replyed, <hi>I am now come again becauſe I wronged my Maſter while I was his Servant, for it was I that ſtole his Shekel</hi> (this was a Jewiſh Shekel of Gold that with ſome other things had been ſtoln from him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years before) <hi>which I hid under the Hearth-ſtone in the Kitchen, and when I fled I took it up, and offered to ſell it to a</hi> French-<hi>woman who lodged in the</hi> Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate <hi>where I then ſerved, who askt where I had it, I told her I found it between</hi> Leith <hi>and</hi> Edenburgh; <hi>One night,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I was riding home late from the Town, and by the way my Horſe ſtumbling I ſaid,</hi> the Devil raiſe thee, <hi>whereupon the foul Thief appeared preſently to me and threatned me, that if I would not promiſe to deſtroy my Maſter the Miniſter he would throw me into a deep hole there, which I ſuppoſe is ſtill to be ſeen near a place called the</hi> Fauſide Brae, <hi>or if I could not get power over my Maſter I ſhould endeavour to deſtroy the School-Maſter;</hi> It is very remarkable that one of the Miniſters Maids had given to the School-Maſters Maid ſome Linnen to waſh, among which was a croſs-cloth of ſtrong Linnen which could not be found, till one morning the Maſter awaking found it bound round his Night-cap, which cauſed admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration both in himſelf and wife, and ſhewed that the Devil nor the Witch had no further power of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:153159:50"/>him, though it is probable they deſigned to ſtrangle him therewith in the night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabel Heriot</hi> or her Ghoſt confeſt likewiſe that the Devil met her a ſecond time at <hi>Elſiſton</hi> Mill within a quarter of a mile of <hi>Ormiſton,</hi> and that as ſhe another time was coming home from <hi>Hadington</hi> Market with Corn the Devil again appeared to her and bid her deſtroy <hi>Thomas Anderſon</hi> who was riding with her, and becauſe ſhe refuſed, the Daemon threw the Corn off the Horſe, and it is well known that her Corn lay there all night, and ſhe went early next morning to fetch it home. And ſays ſhe, I cheated my Maſter when I went to the Market to buy Oats, by telling him it coſt more than it did, and do not you remember <hi>Iſabel Murray,</hi> ſays ſhe, that one night coming out of the Miniſters houſe you had a ſore blow on the back with a ſtone, it was I that did it, yet not for your own ſake, but your husbands who once threw me down and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me; After this Conference the woman began to be afraid, and leaving the Spectre came running home with all ſpeed; This <hi>Iſabel Heriot</hi> was never reputed a Witch nor accuſed by any, but was very ignorant in Religion, and travelled oft in the night; But this Diſturbance and Apparition after her death made it believed that it was either her real body acted by the Devil, or elſe Satan taking upon him her ſhape and form, and imitating her to the life which ſeems moſt probable. <hi>Inviſib.

               <p>IN 1559. at a Village called <hi>Joachims</hi> Valley in <hi>Germany</hi> dwelt a Smith that had a Daughter who excelled in modeſty and virtue, being very conſtant and diligent in all pious Exerciſes, and yet by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine permiſſion was ſet upon by Satan who took and threw her very often upon the ground as if ſhe had been vexed with the falling ſickneſs; This ſo afflicted her Father and Mother that they went to a Wizzard or Conjurer for help but in vain, for the Devil boaſted that by this their folly his power over the Maid was more confirmed and increaſed; A while after Satan began to ſpeak in the Virgin with an human voice and often appeared in the form of a Cuckow, of a Crow, of Hornets, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and exactly imitated their voices; He utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many ſtrange and wonderful matters through her, ſo that the report cauſed a multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to come and viſit her, and divers out of an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt zeal did provoke the Daemon to ſpeak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly heard his anſwers; In the mean time the young woman did patiently endure her afflictions, inceſſantly joining her prayers with thoſe of the Church made on her behalf, and as oft as ſhe called upon the name of Chriſt, and humbly prayed to be freed from that evil one by whom ſhe was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153159:53"/>the Devil raged the more furiouſly, her eyes ſwelling almoſt out of her head, her tongue was twiſted out of her mouth like a ſlender twig, and ſtretched almoſt the length of a mans hand, her face was wound and turned about to her back, and the Devil tormented her in a moſt deplorable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without intermiſſion. If any inquired how ſhe did, and in what condition, ſhe anſwered, <hi>That to her apprehenſion ſhe ſeemed as though ſhe were ſtuck at the bottom of a River ready to be drowned, but that by the coming of ſome Miniſters ſhe deemed her ſelf ſnatched out of the Jaws of Death;</hi> All the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preachers and Divines came dayly to her, who talking with the Virgin the Devil anſwered them, and when the name of Chriſt was mentioned he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways blaſphemed: Being demanded how he entred into her, He ſaid, <hi>In a draught of Ale in the form of a Fly;</hi> She continued under this viſitation above two years, and one <hi>Helias Hirſch</hi> a very pious Miniſter watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her ſeveral nights ſtriving earneſtly in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for her deliverance, the Fiend raged againſt him, and abuſed him with baſe and opprobirous language, and when he was coming out of his own houſe the evil Spirit foretold ſaying, <hi>Behold this Sacrilegious</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias <hi>is coming again to afflict me.</hi> This Virtuous man by the power of Gods word did wonderfully oppoſe him, and by frequently uſing the name of Jeſus Chriſt drove the Devil to new outrages, ſo that the noiſe of his madneſs was heard afar off; Sometimes ſpeaking to <hi>Helias</hi> he would ſay, <hi>Oh now dance with me and either go before or follow as thou pleaſeſt;</hi> The good man replyed, <hi>Let thy Dances lead thee to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Hell,</hi> The Daemon anſwered, <hi>Go thy ways thou ſhalt now ſee dances;</hi> Then he roared and bellowed, ſoon after entring into a Stove he appeared in the ſhape of a Cat and a Dog, who with much agility danced about, and then vaniſhed, many ſuch pranks be plaid. Some time after, this worthy man ſet upon the Devil again demanding, by what means or
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153159:54"/>power he had poſſeſſed the Virgin, <hi>By the command of God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>from whom I am ſent that I might torment the body, but I cannot hurt her ſoul, and that I might give warning to men to abſtain from pride, uſury, glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and other ſins of that kind, and though it be ſore againſt my will to declare theſe things, yet being commanded by God I am forced to do it; At the laſt day I know I ſhall have more Souls than God himſelf will have;</hi> To which one of the Miniſters then preſent replyed; <q>Thou lyeſt O thou wicked Sacrilegious wretch, for if Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will repent they ſhall have Salvation, but the Eternal God at the day of Judgment will throw thee and thy Companions into Hell fire; why didſt thou baniſh thy ſelf out of Heaven when God created thee a glorious Angel?</q> 
                  <hi>My Seat was not fixed there ſure</hi> ſaith the Daemon, <hi>but thou may'ſt as well ſpare thy pains, for I am not ignorant how careful thou waſt for this</hi> Margaret (ſo he called the Virgin though her name was <hi>Ann</hi>) <hi>and that at</hi> Whitſontide <hi>thou madeſt publick Prayers to God for her;</hi> 
                  <q>I have done ſo, replied the Miniſter, and I will not give over to do ſo ſtill till we have thrown thee down headlong into Hell by our Prayers; After this, ſays the Divine, waſt not thou alſo ſent to afflict holy <hi>Job?</hi>

                  <hi>What then,</hi> ſays Satan, <hi>Oh that I had now the like power given me that I might ſcatter the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi> This conference continued about two hours; Among other things the Miniſter ſaid; <q>Behold thou that waſt the chief and moſt beautiful of the Creatures, and the top of the Creation, how art thou fallen, that thou now hideſt thy ſelf under the ugly ſhape of a Hog,</q> Dog, or other unclean Beaſt! <hi>O good Prieſt ſay not ſo,</hi> replied the Devil, <hi>for I am often transformed into an Hare, and am a dainty diſh for great men;</hi> A few days after this good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine brought the Maid into the Congregation among a great Aſſembly who prayed to God for her, and praiſed him with Hymns and Pſalms, and as oft as Jeſus Chriſt was named, the Daemon raged with a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:153159:54"/>bellowing and hideous, noiſe, as though he would ruin and deſtroy all; The Maid being carried home from the Church, the Devil roared in her like the noiſe of a Warlike Trumpet ſaying, It would little profit them to remove him from that place ſince eight more of his Companions were there alſo; At length the Miniſter of <hi>Slackwaldenſis</hi> with ten others met together, and prayed fervently from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till noon, reading alſo the Scriptures and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms with much zeal and earneſtneſs, and then went to Dinner; After they had dined the Miniſters returned and brought with them the Governor of the Caſtle of <hi>Prague,</hi> and a great Company were preſent, who with one accord joined in ſinging praiſes to, and calling upon Jeſus Chriſt, and with ardent affections and ſtrong cryes poured out their ſupplications to God, at which time the Devil was caſt out, and flew out of the Window like a ſwarm of Flys; But before he went he deſired the Maid that he might remain but in any one part of her body, in the Nail of her Finger and at laſt to be only in one Hair, but ſhe abſolutely denyed him in all; Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more juſt upon his departing he ſpoke after this manner; <hi>All ye contemners of the Word of God, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Sacraments, all ye that are addicted to Uſury and Gluttony are mine Body and Soul,</hi> and he further warned and admoniſhed the Miniſter aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; That ſhe ſhould earneſtly exhort all the People that belonged to his Church to repentance; For God deſires our Salvation, and therefore the Devil was compelled againſt his will to warn men to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Sins. When Satan was thus diſpoſſeſſed the Maid was carried home to her Fathers houſe in her right mind, and with great joy and conſolation of Soul, earneſtly recommending her ſelf to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church to be conſtantly remembred in their Publick Prayers; <hi>Fincelius</hi> 3. <hi>Book Miracles.</hi>

Next day the houſe-hold-ſtuff was carried to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſe where there was a Family, theſe diſtreſſed people being to live in one end of it, and the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the other, but before the man and his wife went to bed there was duſt again thrown upon them, wherewith they were ſo affrighted that the man hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Friend with him took a Lanthorn and Candle, and came to me, (ſaith the Relator Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> then Miniſter of the Town) who was in bed and aſleep, but when I was awakened I heard him ſay; <hi>The hand of God ſtill purſues me,</hi> and ſo he intreated me to go down with him, accordingly I and my brother went to the houſe where we found them greatly troubled by reaſon of the things that were thrown about, and ſome were flung preſently after we came in; Hereupon we went to prayers, and as I was kneeling down duſt was thrown upon me, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all was quiet during prayers. I then began to read the ninety firſt Pſalm, the man ſtanding by and holding the Candle, but preſently ſomewhat beat out the light; Whereupon the man ſaid, <hi>That ſome body elſe muſt hold it;</hi> Then a Knife was thrown at me, which fell behind me, my brother ſaid he ſaw it come; A chopping Knife was thrown at the mans wife, whereupon he ſaid, <hi>Things are flung at others for my ſake;</hi> At length he fell upon his knees and confeſſed; That he had been an Hypocrite and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:153159:58"/>a Pilfering Fellow, and that he had robbed his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; &amp;c. And he was willing to ſeparate the things which he had wrongfully taken from the reſt, which he did accordingly, laying forth ſeveral things which he ſaid were none of his, naming the Perſons from whom he had taken them; And as a great Cheſt was carrying forth, Trenchers, Platters and other things were thrown about in ſuch a dreadful manner, that one preſent not counted very religious cryed out, <hi>Pray come and let us go to Prayers,</hi> which they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſpending the night therein and in reading the Scriptures and ſinging Pſalms; And though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things were thrown, as a diſh ſeveral times with which I had once a ſmart blow on the cheek, and the man of the houſe had his boots thrown at him and a chopping knife twice, Crabbs out of a Tub in the midſt of the Room, a Firebrand, an Hammer flung twice and a Bible, yet ſtill during the time of Prayers all was quiet. In the morning as I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain going to Prayers I was hit with a diſh, and then my brother and I returning home, we went aſide by the way to ſpeak with a Friend, but before we got home we heard that the houſe was on fire, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſent for me again, and in the mean time carried out their goods, pluckt off the Thatch, and quenched the fire, yet as I heard it kindled again and again till all the mans goods were brought out, and when theſe people (whoſe houſe was burnt down to the ground) together with all their Goods were removed into the Field all was quiet in this ſecond houſe; Yet ſome things were thrown in the Field, and in the afternoon when another Miniſter and I went to them ſome aſſured us that ſeveral things had been thrown. This was <hi>Nov.</hi> 11. The night following ſome noiſe was heard among the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuff as was teſtified to me; Thus were theſe poor Creatures diſtreſſed, their houſe was burned down, that other to which they were removed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times fired, ſo that neither they nor their goods
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:153159:58"/>might ſtay any longer there, nor durſt any other receive them, but they with their houſe-hold-ſtuff were forced to lye in the open field for divers days and nights together, being made a ſad ſpectacle to all forts of people who came far and near to ſee and hear this wonderful buiſineſs.

               <p>IT has been a received opinion among all that do but know the name of <hi>Laplanders</hi> that they are people addicted to Magick, and they are deſcribed both by ancient and Modern Writers to have arrived to ſo great skill in enchantments that among ſeveral ſtrange effects of their Art they could ſtop Ships when under Sail, which demonſtrates them to be the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the <hi>Biarmi,</hi> who could either by their looks, words, or ſome other artifice ſo inſnare and bewitch men as to deprive them of the uſe of Limbs, and reaſon, and oft indanger their lives; But though in theſe latter times they do not ſo frequently pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe this, and dare not profeſs it ſo publickly as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being ſeverely prohibited by the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> whoſe Subjects they are, yet there are ſtill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who give themſelves wholly to this ſtudy, as thinking thereby to be defended from the injuries and malicious deſigns of others, and therefore they have Teachers and Profeſſors of this Science; and Parents in their laſt Will bequeath to their Children as the greateſt part of their Eſtate thoſe Spirits and Devils that have been any ways ſerviceable to them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:153159:59"/>in their life time. <hi>Gunilda</hi> a Virgin (ſays <hi>Sturleſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>) was ſent by her Father <hi>Odzor Huide</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Halogaland</hi> to <hi>Motle</hi> King of <hi>Finlapland</hi> in <hi>Norway</hi> to be inſtructed in this Art and many arrive to great perfection in theſe curſed ſtudies. Each houſe hath peculiar Spirits and of different natures, ſome being not to be prevailed upon but by much intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereas others offer themſelves even to little Children whom they find ſit for their turn, ſo that divers of the Inhabitants are almoſt naturally Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians even from their Infancy, in which tender age if the Devil takes a liking to any perſon as a fit inſtrument for his deſigns, he preſently ſeizes on him by ſome diſeaſe, in which he haunts him with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Apparitions, from whence according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of his years and underſtanding he learns what belongs to his Art, and becomes ſo knowing that without the uſe of the inchanted Drum (of which we ſhall relate ſomething) they can ſee things at the greateſt diſtance, and are ſo poſſeſt by the Devil that they ſee them even againſt their will, of which take the following example. A certain <hi>Laplander</hi> who is yet alive, upon my complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for his Drum, brought it to me and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt with tears, that though he ſhould part with it, and not make another he ſhould have the ſame Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he had formerly, and he inſtanc't in my ſelf, giving me a true and particular account of what had happened to me in my Journey to <hi>Lapland.</hi> And he further complained that he knew not how to make uſe of his eyes ſince things altogether diſtant were preſented to them.</p>
               <p>This Drum is made out of a hollow piece of wood, and muſt either be of Pine, Firr, or Birch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree which grows in ſuch a particular place and turns directly according to the Suns courſe, whom they worſhip with all imaginable devotion under the Image of <hi>Thor;</hi> the piece of wood they make it of muſt be of the root cleft in ſunder, and made
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:153159:59"/>hollow on one ſide, upon which they ſtretch a skin, ſo that it is like a Kettle-drum, on which they paint ſeveral red Pictures, and draw in the middle divers lines quite croſs, upon which they place thoſe Gods to whom they pay the greateſt adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Thor</hi> the chief God with his Attendants which are drawn on the top of the line, after this they draw another line parallel to the former on which ſtands the Image of Chriſt with ſome of his Apoſtles, and above theſe, Birds, Stars, and the Moon, below the Sun they paint Bears, Wolves, Rain-dears, Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Foxes, Serpents and the like; Upon the Drum they have a Hand or Index like that of a Clock, and then with an hammer made of a Rain-dears horn they beat the Drum ſoftly at firſt, and then louder till they move the hand over the pictures and find out what they deſire, and hereby they believe they can effect very ſtrange things eſpecially as to their hunting, their religious affairs, or laſtly inquiring of things in Forreign Countreys or at a far diſtance, both he that beats the Drum and the reſt are all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their knees; Thoſe who deſire to underſtand the condition of their Friends, or concerns abroad though at five hundred or a thouſand miles diſtance go to ſome <hi>Laplander</hi> or <hi>Finlander</hi> skilfull in this art, and preſent him with a linnen garment or piece of Silver as a reward for ſatisfying their demands; Of which we read this inſtance upon record at <hi>Bergen</hi> a famous Market Town in <hi>Norway</hi> where the effects of the <hi>German</hi> Merchants are regiſtred. In this place one <hi>John Delling</hi> then Factor to a <hi>German</hi> inquired of a certain <hi>Finlapper</hi> of <hi>Norway</hi> about his Maſter then in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Finlapper</hi> readily conſenting to tell him, like a drunken man preſently made a great bawling, then reeling and dancing about ſeveral times in a Circle fell at laſt upon the ground lying there ſome time as if he were dead, then ſtarting upon a ſudden, he related to him all things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Maſter, which were afterward found to agree
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:153159:60"/>to what he reported; There are many more inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind, the moſt conſiderable is one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Laplander</hi> now living who gave <hi>Torneus</hi> an account of the Journey he firſt made to <hi>Lapland</hi> though he had never ſeen him before that time, which though it were true, <hi>Torneus</hi> diſſembled to him leſt he might glory too much in his deviliſh pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and rely upon them as the only means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might attain to truth.</p>
               <p>As to the method of making diſcoveries it is very different; <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> deſcribes it thus; The drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer goes into ſome private room accompanied by one ſingle perſon, beſides his wife, and by beating the drum moves the Index about, muttering at the ſame time ſeveral charms, and then preſently he falls into an extaſy, and lyes for a ſhort time as if dead; Mean while his companion takes great care that no Gnat Fly, or other living creature touch him; For his Son his carried by ſome evil <hi>Genius</hi> into a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countrey from whence it is brought back with a Knife, Ring, or ſome other token of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is done in thoſe parts; Afterward riſing up he relates all the circumſtances belonging to the buſineſs that was inquired after, and that they may appear certainly to be true he ſhews what he brought from thence; Some think them not really but in appearance dead during this trance, others are apt to believe that the Soul departs from the Body, and after its travel abroad returns home again; But without doubt it is impoſſible either for Man or Devil to reſtore the Soul to the Body it hath once left, ſo that it is more probable the Devil only ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles the faculties of the Soul for a time, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their Operations. After the Drummer falls down they lay his Drum near his head, and leave not off ſinging all the time he lyes ſweating in this agony, which they do, not only to put him in mind when he awakes of the buſineſs he was to know, but alſo to recover him out of his trance,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:153159:60"/>which he would never do, as they imagin if they either ceaſed ſinging or any one ſtirred him with their hand or foot, perhaps and this is the reaſon they ſuffer no Fly nor other living creature to touch him, and upon this account only watch him ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and not out of any fear they have leſt the Devil ſhould take away his body, as ſome affirm; It is uncertain how long they lye in this manner, but it is commonly according as the place where they make their diſcovery is nearer or farther off, but the time never exceeds twenty fours hours let the place be at never ſo great a diſtance. After which he awakes, and as we have ſaid ſhews ſome tokens to confirm their belief of what he relates to them. Several Inhabitants of <hi>Kiema</hi> in <hi>Lapland</hi> were apprehended in 1671. with Drums for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of ſo large a ſize that they could not be removed from thence but were burnt in the place. Among theſe <hi>Laplanders</hi> there was one of fourſcore years of age that confeſſed he was bred up in this Art from his Childhood, who in 1670. upon ſome quarrel about a pair of Mittens cauſed a Countreyman of <hi>Kiema</hi> to be drowned in a Cataract, for which he was condemned to dye, and in order to that was to be carried in chains to the next Town in <hi>Bothnia,</hi> but in the Journey he contrived ſo by his Art that on a ſudden, though he ſeemed well and luſty, he died on the Sledge, which he had often foretold he would ſooner do than fall into the Hangmans hands. <hi>Hiſt.

Of whom this Story is related that happened not long ſince; An Inhabitant of <hi>Helieland</hi> who is ſtill alive going toward the mountains of <hi>Norway</hi> to hunt Bears, came to a Cave under the ſide of an Hill, where he found an Image rudely ſhapen, which was the Idol of ſome <hi>Finlanders,</hi> near this ſtood a <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesk</hi> or Magical Bag or Satchel, he opened it, and found therein ſeveral blewiſh Flyes crawling about which they call <hi>Gans</hi> or Spirits, and are dayly ſent out by the <hi>Finlanders</hi> to execute their deviliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; And it is related that the <hi>Finlanders</hi> cannot live peaceably except they let out of their ſatchel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day one of theſe Flyes or Devils; But if the <hi>Gan</hi> can find no man to deſtroy after they have ſent him out, which they ſeldom do upon no account at all, then he roves about at a venture, and kills the firſt thing he meets with; Sometimes they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it to go into the mountains to cleave Rocks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder: However theſe Conjurers will for very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial cauſes ſend out their <hi>Gan</hi> to ruin men; This they uſe likewiſe as well againſt one another as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, nay ſometimes againſt thoſe whom they know are their equals in the art.</p>
               <p>Of this kind there happened a notable paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two <hi>Finlanders,</hi> one of them called <hi>Asbioren Gankonge</hi> from his great knowledge in the art, the other upon ſome ſmall difference concerning their Skill or ſome ſuch triflle would have deſtroyed <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bioren</hi> but was ſtill prevented by his too powerful art, till at laſt finding an opportunity as <hi>Asbioren</hi> lay ſleeping under a rock, he immediately diſpatcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a <hi>Gan</hi> that cleft the rock in ſunder and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:153159:61"/>it upon him. This happened in the time of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Claud</hi> not long before he writ his Hiſtory; Some of their Conjurers are contented only with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to expel them, and free men from the miſchief that they do them, as alſo to Beaſts. This is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among them that they can hurt no man with their <hi>Gan</hi> except they firſt know his Parents name.</p>
               <p>Now all that the <hi>Finlanders</hi> and <hi>Finlappers</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> effect by their <hi>Gan,</hi> the <hi>Laplanders</hi> do by a thing that they call <hi>Tyre;</hi> This <hi>Tyre</hi> is a round ball about the bigneſs of a walnut or ſmall apple made of the fineſt hair of a beaſt, or elſe of moſs, very ſmooth, and ſo light that it ſeems hollow, its colour is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of yellow, green and aſh, but ſo that the yellow may appear moſt, I had one of them given me (ſaith my Author) by a Gentleman. This <hi>Tyre</hi> they ſay is quickned and moved by a particular art, it is ſold by the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and he who buys it may hurt whom he pleaſes therewith; They perſwade themſelves and others that by the <hi>Tyre</hi> they can ſend either Serpents, Toads, Mice, or what they pleaſe into the body of any man to make his torment the greater; It goes like a whirlwind, and as ſwift as an arrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the firſt man or beaſt that it lights on, of which there are dayly too many Inſtances in that Countrey which abounds with theſe miſerable Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of the Devil. <hi>Ibidem. p.</hi> 60.</p>

               <p>ANother thing wherein the <hi>Laplanders</hi> have for many ages been accounted famous or rather infamous is their ſelling of Winds to Saylers, to which they have proper inſtruments as well as in the reſt of their wretched Sciences; They tye three magical knots in a cord, when they unty the firſt knot there blows a favourable gale of Wind, when the ſecond a brisker, when the third the Sea and wind grow mighty ſtormy and tempeſtuous, ſo that they will neither be able to direct their Ship, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:153159:68"/>and at her deſire went down with her to a Wood a <hi>Gallowater</hi> near the <hi>Stow,</hi> when they were come to this place and had tarried a conſiderable time, and ſaw no body, he began to be tired, &amp; told his wife he would be gone, but ſhe intreated him to ſtay a while longer aſſuring him the Gentleman would not fail her; At length there appeared a great black Maſtiff Dog which ran toward the man, and put him into ſuch a conſternation and aſtoniſhment that he knew not where he was; But his wife endeavoured to comfort him, ſtill confidently affirming that the Gentleman would come preſently &amp; perform what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; And accordingly in a ſhort ſpace the Devil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf in the ſhape of a black man, &amp; fitting his diſcourſe to the mans temptation, made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes to him that if he would become his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, he would teach him ſeveral ways how to be rich, and to be reſpected by all the Countrey; Unto which propoſal of the Devil he confeſſed he conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ſo much in hope of any future riches as for fear leſt he ſhould be inſtantly deſtroyed by him, for he began very much to ſuſpect it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who then gave him this charge, <hi>That he ſhould be his Officer to warn all his Helliſh Vaſſals to their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> as was ſaid, wherein he continued till he was apprehended; He was very ingenious in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion whereof this was a ſtrong evidence, That there was neither Man nor Woman accuſed by him, but when they were apprehended all confeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty, confirming what he had declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſt them, and acknowledging the truth thereof to their very deaths.</p>
               <p>One inſtance is remarkable, that after he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered divers, and as many were taken and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned as the Jayl would convenient hold and the Keepers could attend, he diſcloſed another Woman in the Town of <hi>Lauder</hi> whoſe name the Magiſtrates reſolved to conceal till the Priſon ſhould be emptied of ſome of thoſe who were already apprehended and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:153159:69"/>had confeſſed; And accordingly all perſons that knew it were enjoined to be ſecret in the matter; But that very night the Devil came to her and told her that <hi>Hob Grieve</hi> had charged her to be a Witch, but aſſured her that if ſhe would riſe and go and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him for it, and never come away till he and ſhe were brought face to face, that then he would again deny it; Whereupon ſhe aroſe and coming to the Priſon Window fell a railing againſt <hi>Hob Grieve</hi> calling him Wizzard and Slave to the Devil, with all other vile names ſhe could utter; And when the Watch and the Magiſtrates deſired her to go home ſhe ſate down upon the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> ſtairs and ſaid, <hi>ſhe would never go to her houſe till ſhe and that Slave of the Devil were confronted;</hi> Whereupon the Bayliff went to the Miniſter deſiring him to come and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her to go home ſince none accuſed her; Who accordingly came and endeavoured to prevail with her, but ſhe obſtinately refuſed to go till ſhe could ſee that Raſcal who had accuſed her an honeſt Woman for a Witch; The Bayliff was at length conſtrained to comply; Whereupon taking ſeveral witneſſes with him ſhe was carried into the room where <hi>Hob Grieve</hi> was; When ſhe came into his ſight ſhe fell on her knees and began to rail at him, accuſing him for a wicked Lyar in nominating her; <hi>Thou common Theif,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>how dareſt thou for thy Soul ſay that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153159:69"/>Meetings, and thou and I have gone thither toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</q> And then he nominated ſeveral places, and told the actions done by her and others there, to all which, ſaid he, I am an eye-witneſs; By this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhe was ſo confounded that immediately in the preſence of the Bayliff, the Miniſter, the School-Maſter and divers others ſhe cryed out; "<hi>O now,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I perceive the Devil is a Lyar and a Murderer from the beginning, for this very night be came to me, and bid me come and abuſe thee and never to return till I had confronted thee, aſſuring me that thou wouldſt deny all and ſay,</hi> Thou falſe Tongue thou haſt lied; Having ſaid thus ſhe with many tears confeſſed that all was true which <hi>Grieve</hi> had ſaid praying the Miniſter that he would beſeech God to have mercy on her Soul, that ſhe might be delivered out of the hands of the Devil; She continued in this confeſſion to the day of her death.</p>
               <p>Another Evidence of the ingenuity of <hi>Hob Grieve</hi> was that when five or ſix Men and Women whom he had diſcovered were taken and had confeſſed their Witchcraft, he earneſtly deſired that himſelf and all the reſt might be carried to Church on the Lords day to hear the Word of God; Which being granted and they accordingly brought thither with a Guard they all fate down together before the Pulpit.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Witchcraft and impriſoned thirteen weeks during which (ſaith the Relator who was a Miniſter of the place) I repaired to her but found her very impenitent; In all her diſcourſe ſhe was ſo ſubtle that I could not get any advantage by her words, ſo
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:153159:71"/>that I ſometimes thought ſhe was an innocent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and was much grieved for her hard uſage, if it could have been helpt, and ſecretly wiſhed ſhe had never been medled with; Yea I could have been glad ſhe might make her eſcape, ſo I were ignorant of it, for I much feared all we could prove againſt her would not be ſufficient evidence to bring her to a Tryal; Or if ſhe were tryed I doubted the Jury would not condemn her unleſs I adviſed them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſince we knew nothing but that ſhe had a bad report, and I was very loth to be ſo far concerned, and if I had not, and ſhe ſhould have got her liberty, I ſhould have then been blamed for not adviſing them to condemn her; At this inſtant one <hi>Alexander Bogs</hi> who was counted very Skilful in diſcovering Teats and Marks of the Devil, being ſent for to her, came and found the Mark upon her back bone wherein he thruſt a great braſs pin of which ſhe was not ſenſible neither did any bloud follow when it was drawn out; I judged this but a ſmall evidence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of what I afterward found, yet this ſomewhat inclined the Judges to ſend her Proceſs to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> where with ſome difficulty a Commiſſion was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to try her; But then my fears augmented, for the chiefeſt man in the Pariſh refuſed to appear againſt her profeſſing he thought all that was proved againſt her were only idle ſtories, and ſome of the Judges were alſo of that opinion, however I my ſelf could not but think her guilty, after which there was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence thereof; For <hi>Nov.</hi> 28. in the evening I went to exhort her to a confeſſion, <hi>Alexander Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> the Church Officer and my own ſervant being preſent, but when I had uſed many arguments in vain we left her; Coming to the ſtair head I reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hearken a little what ſhe would ſay by her ſelf, in a very ſhort ſpace ſhe began to diſcourſe as if ſome body had been with her; Her voice was ſo low I could not underſtand what ſhe ſaid, only one Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whereby I perceived ſhe was relating that I
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:153159:72"/>had accuſed her and ſhe had denyed; Soon after I heard another voice whiſpering as it were to her which I preſently apprehended to be Satan, this diſcourſe continued ſome time, ſhe ſpeaking and the other voice anſwering in a long ſentence which none of us could underſtand, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he began to ſpeak before ſhe had ended ſo that we could hear two voices at once; At this <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Symſon</hi> was ſo affrighted that he cryed out, though I exhorted him with a loud voice not to fear, and ſo we came all down ſtairs I being much ſatisfied that the buſineſs became ſtill more clear.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other remarkable paſſages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Elizabeth Graham</hi> before her death which make it evident that ſhe was guilty of Witchcraft though ſhe died obſtinate and impenitent; <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. She ſeemed inclined to a confeſſion, and promiſed <hi>William Wats</hi> to tell me to morrow all that was in her heart, when I came to her <hi>Wats</hi> only being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe ſaid ſhe heartily repented her miſ-ſpending ſo much time, but eſpecially her malice toward me which ſhe affirmed the Devil tempted her to; All which time ſhe ſpoke with a very low voice ſo that we could ſcarce hear her though we deſired her to ſpeak out, and asked her the reaſon of it, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; <hi>That when ſhe endeavoured to ſpeak any thing that was for her Souls good ſhe was ſcarce able to utter it, but if ſhe deſired to ſcold and rail as ſhe uſed to do the Devil gave her ſtrength to ſpeak as loud as ever ſhe did;</hi> A while after I ſeriouſly demanded whether ſhe was guilty of Witchcraft or not? At which words ſhe ſtared with her eyes round about the room, and I verily believe ſhe ſaw the Devil, for immediately after ſhe began to rail at me though juſt before ſhe had confeſt that her malice toward me was one chief cauſe of her grief, and ſtill as ſhe proceeded in railing her voice became ſtronger and louder till at laſt ſhe ſpake as loud as ever before. The <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> after I again viſited her, and then ſhe was very
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:153159:72"/>bitter and malicious in her language to me, I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned her what ground of confidence ſhe had that it would be well with her Soul; She replyed, <hi>She had no grounds yet, for ſhe had been a very wicked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and had not yet repented, but ſhe yet hoped ſhe ſhould get repentance, and get Heaven, and a change wrought in her, and though ſhe was to live but a ſhort while, yet ſhe was ſure of it, and that I ſhould ſoon ſee it;</hi> I thought ſhe had ſpoke this in her rage, but in the afternoon ſome came and told me that ſhe was fallen to prayers and in many good words expreſt her own vileneſs and the hopes of Gods mercy, in which ſtrain ſhe continued till night, when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee her found her as before aggravating her guilt, and declaring her hopes of Salvation, and her deſire to dye, and uſing ſuch pithy Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſo often and ſo pertinent that I began much to wonder, conſidering I had ever found her altogether ignorant in matters of Religion both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her impriſonment and after, and therefore much doubted whether it were not a deluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſhe had ſo confidently foretold it in the morning, whereupon ſeriouſly conſidering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I again queſtioned her very ſtrictly whether ſhe were a Witch or not; She freely confeſſed all that had been depoſed againſt her which did not certainly evidence her to be one, but the reſt of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſhe denyed as alſo the crime of Witchcraft it ſelf, however ſhe ſaid ſhe knew ſhe ſhould dye and deſired not to live, and ſhe thought we would be be clear from her bloud before God, for though ſhe were innocent yet there were ſo many things ſworn againſt her that we could hardly believe otherwiſe of her than we did; She was ſoon after executed and died without any acknowledgment of her guilt. <hi>Ibidem.</hi> p. 120.</p>

Thus theſe wicked wretches continued drinking and roaring ſo long till they could hardly ſee one another; At laſt the Devil their Landlord told them they muſt now pay for all, at which their hearts grew cold, but the Devil bid them be of good cheer for now they muſt drink Fire and Brimſtone with him in the Pit of Hell for ever; After which he broke all their necks, and there left them, and thus theſe Drunkards ended their miſerable days; Which dreadful inſtance may inform us that God can make the Devil his Executioner when he pleaſes to shew his vengeance upon notorious ſinners. <hi>Ibidem.</hi> p. 158.</p>

               <p>ANother accident of the ſame kind happened in a part of <hi>Swevia</hi> where a Countreyman walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his ground to ſee his corn in a dry ſeaſon, his little daughter being with him, he wiſhed that it might rain a good ſhower; The Girl hearing her Father ſay ſo, out of her childiſh ſimplicity told him, she could eaſily procure that for him, the Father wondring at the Childs words asked her how ſhe could do ſuch a feat, O ſays ſhe, <hi>I learnt this wick of my Mother,</hi> and added, That ſhe could not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe it to rain but hail, and could raiſe a great Tempeſt and that her Mother was taught by a Maſter who came to her privately, and that whatever ſhe deſired of him was preſently performed, but that her Mother had ſtrictly charged her to tell no body; The Father much terrified at this diſcourſe asked her if ſhe had ever ſeen this Maſter; The Girl replyed ſhe had ſeen many come in and go out, whom her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid were their Maſters and loving Landlords. Her Father again demanded if ſhe could juſt then raiſe a ſhower or ſtorm, ſhe replyed, I, if ſhe had but a little water; He therefore brought her to the

His Servants carried him to ſeveral Farriers but none of them had the Skill to cure him; At laſt unknown to their Maſter they led him to a Farrier who had it ſeems more tricks than ordinary and dealt in Charms, Spels, and ſuch like Ceremonies, by virtue of which he made the Horſe ſound. The owner of him after he had obſerved how well his Horſe was, asked his Servants how they got him cured, from whom underſtanding the whole matter, and likewiſe obſerving that there was an S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon this profeſſion of his diſlike of the cure, the Horſe forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fell as ill as ever inſomuch that for his unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs he was fain to be turned up looſe in the paſture. But a kinſman of the Gentlemans coming to his houſe and chancing to ſee the Horſe in the grounds took the advantage of a low price for ſo fair a Gelding and bought him; The Horſe had no ſooner changed his Maſter, but he preſently chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his plight of body, and became as ſound as ever. <hi>Ibidem. p.</hi> 89.</p>

               <p>The Fourth Perſon who was indamaged by this Hag was one <hi>Edward Newton,</hi> who dealing in <hi>Holland</hi> Cheeſe as well as her ſelf ſhe thought he got more proſit than ſhe, and therefore when ever he bought a bargain of Cheeſe he was grievouſly afflicted, and at length either ſhe or a Spirit in her likeneſs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he lay in bed and whisked a wet cloth of a very lothſome ſmell about his face; After which he ſaw one clothed in ruſſet with a little buſhy beard who told him he was ſent to look upon a ſore leg he had, and to cure it, who riſing to ſhew it him perceived
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153159:79"/>he had cloven feet, and therefore refuſed him, who then ſuddenly vaniſht out of his ſight; Theſe were no vain fancies nor conceits, but real and certain appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; After this <hi>Smith</hi> ſent her Imps, a Toad and Crabs crawling about the room, one of his Servants took the Toad and put it into the fire where it lay groaning a quarter of an hour ere it was conſumed, during which the Witch endured very tormenting pains, and cryed out in a very dreadful manner; <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Newton</hi> then fell ſick which quickly brought him into a frenzy or diſtraction yet with ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions ſo that for a quarter of a year together he would be in his ſenſes and then fall again into raving fits being deprived of all ſence; The joints and parts of his body were benumed, and he had ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pains and griefs as diſabled him from following his imployments, and being adviſed to ſend for the Witch and ſcratch her when ſhe came he had no power to uſe his nails they turning back like feathers and ſo continued in a very weak condition.</p>
               <p>The laſt I ſhall mention is Mr. <hi>Thomas Young</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Fiſhmonger, who coming to her husband to demand a debt, his wife gave him ſeveral curſes and execrations, and three or four days after, Mr. <hi>Young</hi> going thence to <hi>Yarmouth</hi> fell ſick there being tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with exceeding pain and torment, which the moſt able Phyſicians in <hi>Norfolk</hi> could find no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for, ſo that he continued in this lamentable ſtate thirteen months and was conſtrained to go on crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, not being able to feed himſelf, neither did he find any amendment till this wretched woman was committed to priſon being accuſed for other villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the like nature, at which time as near as he can remember he found ſome remiſſion of his former griefs, yet did not perfectly recover his ſtrength, his left hand becoming lame and uſeleſs; Before this happened, a great Spaniel Dog ran over his bed in his lodging the door being faſt ſhut, and upon ſtrict inquiry no ſuch Dog was known to have
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:153159:80"/>been in the houſe nor in the whole Town.</p>
               <p>After ſhe was committed to Priſon ſeveral Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and others went to ſee her, to whom ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the contract ſhe had made with the Devil and the miſchiefs ſhe had done the four Perſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, begging mercy of God as for all her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins ſo eſpecially for that of Witchcraft, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Devil, and ſeeming really penitent for all her former practices; Upon this ſhe was arraigned and condemned to dye, and in the morning before her execution, as ſhe was going out of her chamber to confer with ſome Divines by whoſe prayers and inſtructions ſhe might be recovered out of the Devils hands, he appeared to her like a black man with horns on his head as is before related, earneſtly perſwading her to confeſs nothing but continue conſtant to the promiſe ſhe had made him, and rely upon him, and then he would certainly ſave her, though this is one of his ordinary deluſions, who having brought this this poor creature into his ſnare, left her to dye a ſhameful death. When ſhe came to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſhe made an open confeſſion of her ſins and profeſſion of her faith, in the face of the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, declaring likewiſe the hopes ſhe had to obtain a better life hereafter; Being asked if ſhe would have a Pſalm ſung, ſhe replied, <hi>Moſt willingly,</hi> and deſired them to ſing <hi>The lamentation of a ſinner,</hi> which begins thus, <hi>Lord turn not away thy face from me,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:153159:80"/>the Reſidence of that noble Earl, and where they were not only relieved but entertained as Char-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; After which <hi>Margaret</hi> was admitted to live in the Caſtle as a Servant maid, till at length the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs had information of ſome miſdemeanours they were guilty of, having notice that the Mother was a very malicious woman and much given to ſwearing, curſing and Atheiſtical imprecations, and that of late days her countenance was ſtrangely altered, her eyes fiery and hollow, her ſpeech fierce and envious, and her whole demeanour ſtrange and rediculous, being much alone and having divers other Symptoms of a notorious Witch, and her neighbours reported ſhe had familiar Spirits, and terrified them all with her curſes, and threats of revenge upon the leaſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was done her; She likewiſe heard that her daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> often carried ſuch great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of proviſion from the Caſtle to her Mother as was unfit for a Servant to purloyn, and at ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable hours that it was believed they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver maintain their extraordinary riot and expence without robbing their Lady, to maintain ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Fellows who frequented her mothers houſe for the love of her youngeſt daughter <hi>Philip,</hi> who was likewiſe leudly tranſported with the love of one <hi>Thomas Symſon,</hi> inſomuch as he was heard to ſay ſhe had bewitched him for he had no power to leave her, though he found himſelf much altered both in body and mind ſince he kept her company.</p>
               <p>Such diſcourſes paſſed concerning them ſeveral years before they were apprehended or convicted, of which the Earl and Counteſs took little notice by reaſon of their cunning obſervance and modeſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage toward them; At length my Lord had ſome ſuſpition of the Mother, and eſtranged himſelf from that familiarity and diſcourſe he uſed to have with her, for one <hi>Peak</hi> having wronged her ſhe complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Earl whom ſhe found unwilling to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage clamors and malicious informations, and the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:153159:81"/>Counteſs diſcovering ſome incivilities in her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters life, and her neglect of buſineſs diſcharged her for lying any more in the Caſtle, yet gave her forty Shillings, a Bolſter, and a Bed, commanding her to go home. Upon this the Mother being upbraided by her Neighbours, and told that her daughter was turned out of doors, ſhe curſed all that were the cauſe of it, and ſtudied to revenge her ſelf upon that Honourable Family; The Devil perceiving the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious temper of this wretch, and that she and her daughters were fit inſtruments to inlarge his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, offered them his ſervice, and that in ſuch a manner as should no way terrifie them, nor could they be ſuſpected to be concerned appearing in the shape of a Dog, Cat, or Rat, telling them that if they would make a contract with him, they should have their will upon their enemies and do them what damage they pleaſed. The thoughts of doing miſchief to their ill-willers eaſily induced them all to agree to his damnable propoſals, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be his Body and Soul, confirming their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with abominable kiſſes, and an odious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Bloud, with certain Charms and Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherewith the Devil deceived them; After this theſe three women became Devils incarnate and grew proud in the power they had got to do miſchief by ſeveral Spells and Incantations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they firſt killed what Cattel they pleaſed; Which ſo incouraged them that they now threaten the Earl and his Family, who ſoon after fell ſick with his Counteſs, and were ſubject to ſtrange and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Convulſions, which they judging only to proceed from the hand of God, had not the leaſt jealouſie of any evil practice againſt them.</p>

               <p>That her Mother and Siſter were very malicious againſt the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> his Counteſs and their Children, becauſe <hi>Margaret</hi> was turned out of the Ladies ſervice, whereupon her Siſter by her Mothers order brought from the Caſtle the right hand Glove of the Lord <hi>Henry Roſs,</hi> who preſently rubbed it on the back of her Spirit called <hi>Rutterkin,</hi> and then put it into boyling water, after which ſhe prickt it very often and then buried it in the yard, wiſhing the Lord <hi>Roſs</hi> might never thrive, and ſo her Siſter <hi>Margaret</hi> continued with her Mother, and ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaw her Imp <hi>Rutterkin</hi> leap on her ſhoulder and ſuck her neck, ſhe confeſt alſo that ſhe often heard her mother curſe the Earl and his Lady, and would
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:153159:82"/>thereupon boyl bloud and feathers together, uſing many Deviliſh ſpeeches and ſtrange geſtures, ſhe likewiſe acknowledged that ſhe her ſelf had a Spirit ſucking her left breaſt in the form of a white Rat, which it had done for three or four years paſt, and and that when it came firſt to her ſhe gave her Soul to it, who promiſed to do her good, and to force <hi>Tho. Symſon</hi> to love her if ſhe would ſuffer it to ſuck her which ſhe agreed to, and that it had ſuckt her two nights before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret</hi> her Siſter being examined agreed in the confeſſion that <hi>Philip</hi> had made of their malice to the Earl, and about the young Lords Glove, adding that after ſhe had prickt it <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Roſs</hi> fell ſick within a week, lying in great torment, and ſhortly after died, which her Mother hearing of ſaid, <hi>It was well.</hi> She further ſaid, that finding a Glove about two years ſince of <hi>Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Roſs</hi> the ſecond Son on a Dunghill, ſhe gave it her Mother who put it into hot water, and after took it out and rub'd it on <hi>Rutterkin</hi> her Cat, and bid him go upwards and afterward buried it in the yard and ſaid, <hi>a miſchief light on him but he will mend again;</hi> She confeſſed alſo that her Mother and ſhe, and her Siſter contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo to bewitch the Earl and his Counteſs that they might have no more Children, for turning her out of the Caſtle at which her Mother was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged that ſhe ſwore dreadfully to be revenged; Her malice increaſing becauſe ſhe thought the Earl did not take her part againſt one <hi>Peak</hi> who had abuſed her, whereupon they took Wooll out of the bed the Lady had given her, and a pair of Gloves of the Earls, and put them into warm water mingled with bloud ſtirring it together, and then taking them out, rubb'd them on <hi>Rutterkin</hi> her Imp, ſaying, <hi>The Lord and the Lady ſhould have more Children but it would be long firſt.</hi> She likewiſe confeſt that ſhe brought her Mother a piece of the Lady <hi>Katherines</hi> Handkercher and her Mother put it in water, and rubb'd it on
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:153159:82"/>her Spirit bidding him <hi>fly and go,</hi> whereupon he whined and cryed mew, at which ſhe ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Rutterkin <hi>had no power over the Lady</hi> Katherine <hi>to hurs her.</hi> She alſo acknowledged that ſhe had two Familiar Spirits ſucking on her, one white, and the other black and ſpotted, the white ſuckt under her breaſt, and the black in the lower parts of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; When ſhe firſt entertained them ſhe promiſed them her Soul, and they covenanted to do all the miſchief ſhe commanded them; Laſtly ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. four Devils appeared to her in <hi>Lincoln</hi> Jayl about twelve a Clock at night, one ſtanding at her bed-ſide with a black head like an Ape and ſpoke to her, but the words ſhe could not underſtand, at which ſhe was very angry becauſe he ſpoke not plainer that ſhe might know his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other three were <hi>Rutterkin, little Robin,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that ſhe never feared ſhe ſhould loſe her life, nor ſuſpected their treachery till that time.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time <hi>Joan Willimot</hi> of <hi>Goadby</hi> a Witch was examined by Sir <hi>Henry Haſtings</hi> and Dr. <hi>Fleming</hi> Juſtices in <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> about the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Roſs,</hi> who declared, that <hi>Joan Flower</hi> told her the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> had dealt badly by her, and had put away her Daughter, and though ſhe could not have her will of my Lord himſelf, yet ſhe had ſped my Lords Son, and had ſtricken him to the heart. She further confeſſed that to her own knowledge my Lords Son was ſtruck with a white Spirit, and that ſhe can cure thoſe who ſend to her; and that ſome reward her for her pains, and or others ſhe takes nothing; Acknowledging that ſhe had a Spirit which ſhe called <hi>Pretty</hi> given her by <hi>William Berry</hi> of <hi>Langholm</hi> in <hi>Rutlandſhire</hi> to whom ſhe was a ſervant three years, and that when her Maſter gave it her he bid her open her mouth and he would blow a Fairy into her which ſhould do her good, and accordingly he blowed into her mouth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:153159:83"/>and ſoon after there came a Spirit out of her mouth which ſtood on the ground in the form of a woman who asked her to give her Soul to her, which ſhe then promiſed by the inſtigation of her Maſter; She ſaid ſhe never hurt any body, but helpt divers who were bewitcht, and that her Spirit came to her weekly, giving her an account who were thus afflicted, and that the night before it came like a woman, mumbling ſomewhat ſhe could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. And being asked whether ſhe were not in a dream, ſhe affirmed ſhe was awake as much as at that inſtant. Another time her Spirit told her there was a bad woman at <hi>Deeping</hi> who had given her Soul to the Devil, and that her Spirit did then appear in a more hideous form than it had formerly done, and much urged her to give it ſomething though but a piece of her Girdle, ſaying it had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken great pains for her, but ſhe refuſed to give it any thing: She ſaid further that <hi>John Pachet</hi> whoſe child was bewitcht to death might have had it alive if he would have ſought help in time, and that <hi>Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hets</hi> Wife had an evil thing within her which would make an end of her, which ſhe knew by her Girdle, and accordingly ſhe died ſoon after; And that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel Greete</hi> of <hi>Waltham</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> a Shepherd had a Spirit like a Mouſe which went into his Body at the time he contracted to give his Soul to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, after which if he lookt maliciouſly upon any thing it received hurt thereby, and that he had a mark on his left arm which was cut away, of which her own Spirit inform'd her before he left her; Upon a ſecond Examination ſhe confeſt that <hi>Joan Flower</hi> and her Daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> met together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a week before their apprehenſion in <hi>Black-bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> Hill, and went thence to <hi>Joan Flowers</hi> houſe where ſhe ſaw two Spirits one like a Rat, and the other like an Owl, and one of them ſuckt her right ear as ſhe thought, and <hi>Joan</hi> told her that her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits had promiſed ſhe ſhould neither be hanged nor
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:153159:83"/>burnt, and then took up ſome earth and ſpit upon it, working it with her Fingers, and put it into her purſe ſaying, <hi>Though ſhe could not hurt the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet ſhe had ſped his Son who is dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Witch called <hi>Ellen Green</hi> of <hi>Stathorn</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> was examined about that time by the ſame Juſtices who confeſſed that <hi>Joan Willimot</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovenamed came to her about ſix years ſince, and perſwaded her to forſake God and betake her ſelf to the Devil to which she conſented, who then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led two Spirits one like a young Cat which she na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Puſs,</hi> and the other in the shape of a Mole which she called <hi>Hiff, Hiff,</hi> who inſtantly came, and <hi>Willimot</hi> going away left them with her, after which they leapt on her shoulder, the Kitling ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her neck under her right ear, and the Mole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her left in the ſame place; After which ſhe ſent the Kitling to a Baker in the Town who had called her Witch and ſtruck her, bidding it go and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch him to death, and the Mole ſhe ſent to <hi>Ann Daws</hi> of the ſame Town upon the ſame errand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had called her Witch, Whore, and Jade, and within a Fortnight after they both died. After which ſhe ſent them to deſtroy two Husbandmen named <hi>Williſon</hi> and <hi>Williman</hi> who died both in ten days; Theſe four ſhe murdered while ſhe dwelt at <hi>Waltham;</hi> When ſhe removed to <hi>Stathorn</hi> where ſhe now dwelt, upon a difference between her and one <hi>Pachets</hi> Wife a Yeoman there, <hi>Joan Willimot</hi> called her to go and touch <hi>Pachets</hi> Wife and Child which ſhe did, touching the Woman in bed, and the Child in the Midwives arms, and then ſent her Spirits to bewitch them to death, the woman languiſhed a month before ſhe died, but the Child lived only till next day after ſhe had touched it; Adding that <hi>Joan Willimot</hi> had a Spirit ſucking on her like a little white Dog which ſhe ſaw, and that ſhe gave her Soul to the Devil to have theſe Spirits at command for any miſchievous purpoſe, and ſuffered them
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:153159:84"/>to ſuck her conſtantly about the Change and Full Moon.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Ann Baker</hi> a Witch was likewiſe apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and examined about the ſame time who confeſſed before Sr. <hi>George Mannors</hi> and Dr. <hi>Fleming</hi> Juſtices of Peace that ſhe had a Spirit like a white Dog which ſhe called a good Spirit, and that one <hi>Peak</hi> and one <hi>Dennis</hi> his wife of <hi>Belvoir</hi> told her that the young L. <hi>Henry</hi> was dead, and that his Glove was buried in the ground, which as it waſted and rotted in like manner did the Lords Liver rot and waſte like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret</hi> and <hi>Philip Flower</hi> were arraigned at the Aſſizes at <hi>Lincoln</hi> before Sr. <hi>Henry Hobart</hi> and Sr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bromley</hi> Judges, where upon their confeſſing themſelves actors in the deſtruction of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Roſs,</hi> with other damnable practices they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed at <hi>Lincoln March</hi> 11. and the reſt queſtionleſs ſuffered according to their deſerts. <hi>Diſcovery Witchcraft.</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:153159:90"/>which was to hurt Man, Woman, or Child, and the other to deſtroy what Cattel ſhe deſired, and the young man was to lye with her as he did often; And ſaith that <hi>Lilly</hi> according to the Covenant did kill the Child of Mr. <hi>Henry Bedell</hi> of <hi>Catworth,</hi> as ſhe required him to do when ſhe was angry, though she does not now remember for what, and that about two or three days before she ſent him to kill Mr. <hi>Bedell</hi> himſelf, who returned and ſaid, <hi>he had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and that another time she ſent the ſame Spirit to hurt <hi>Edward Muſgrave</hi> of <hi>Catworth</hi> who likewiſe returned ſaying, <hi>he was not able;</hi> And that she ſent her Spirit <hi>Priſcill</hi> to kill two Horſes and two Cows of Mr. <hi>Muſgraves</hi> and <hi>Thomas Thorps</hi> in that Town which was done accordingly; And being askt when the one and twenty years would be out, she ſaid, <hi>To the beſt of her remembrance about Low Sunday next;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further demanded why she did ſo conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to Church and to hear the Sermons of Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> the Miniſter, ſhe ſaid, <hi>She was well pleaſed with his preaching and had a deſire to be rid of that unhappy burthen which was upon her.

               <p>THE other was one <hi>John Winnick</hi> of <hi>Moleſworth</hi> in <hi>Huntingtonſhire,</hi> who being examined <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 11. 1646. before the aforeſaid Juſtices Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that about twenty nine years before he being then a Batchelor lived with one <hi>Bateman</hi> an Inn-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at the <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Thropſton,</hi> who was likewiſe a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, at which time he loſing a purſe with ſeven ſhillings in it, much ſuſpected one of the Family; But the Fryday after being in the Barn making up Hay about noon he fell a ſwearing, curſing, and raging, wishing that ſome Wiſe Body or Wizzard would help him to his Purſe and Money again, when there preſently appeared to him a Spirit black and shaggy, with paws like a Bear, but no bigger than a Rabbit; The Spirit asked him what he ailed to be ſo ſorrowful, who anſwered that he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153159:90"/>had loſt a Purſe and Money and knew not how to come by it again; The Spirit replyed; <hi>If you will forſake God and Chriſt and fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me for your God I will help you to your Purſe and Money again;</hi> To which he conſented and thereupon fell down on his knees and held up his hands.

Then the Bear Spirit told him, <hi>That when he died he muſt have his Soul,</hi> whereunto he yielded; He likewiſe told him that they muſt ſuck his Body, to which he conſented, but they did not ſuck at that time; The Bear Spirit promiſed him he ſhould never want Victuals; The Cat Spirit that it would hurt Cattle when he would deſire it; And that like a Rabbit that it would hurt whoever he commanded it; The Bear Spirit further told him that it muſt have ſome of his bloud where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſeal the Covenant, whereunto he conſented and then it leapt upon his ſhoulder, and prickt him on the head from whence it took bloud, after which all three vaniſht away; Next day about noon theſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:153159:91"/>Spirits came to him while he was in the Field and told him they were come to ſuck of his Body which they did accordingly in the places where, upon his being apprehended, the marks were found, and from that time they came conſtantly once in twenty four hours, ſometimes by day but moſt commonly by night. And being demanded what miſchief he cauſed any of his Spirits to do, he anſwered never any only he ſent his Bear Spirit to Mr. <hi>Says</hi> Servant of <hi>Molſeworth</hi> to provoke her to ſteal Victuals for him out of her Maſters houſe which ſhe did, and he received the ſame.

               <p>I Shall conclude theſe Relations with one Hiſtory more of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and aſſiſtance of a <hi>Good Spirit</hi> among all the Evil Ones we have mentioned, which a Learned <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divine hath thought worth tranſlating out of <hi>Bodinus</hi> a famous Author in his Book of Witches, &amp;c. The main reaſon why the Society of Good Spirits is ſo ſeldom found in Hiſtory is as I conceive becauſe ſo few men are heartily and ſincerely good, and the following Narrative is the more conſiderable, becauſe he who writ it had it from the man's own mouth whom it concerns, and is as follows.</p>
               <p>The Perſon was as it ſeems an holy pious man, and an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>Bodinus,</hi> who freely told him that he had a certain Spirit which did continually accompany him, and which he was firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of about the thirty ſeventh year of his age, but he conceived that this Spirit had been with him all his life time, as he gathered from certain monitory Dreams and Viſions whereby he was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned as well to avoid ſeveral dangers, as many vices and ſins; That this Spirit diſcovered himſelf to him after he had for a whole year together prayed earneſtly to God to ſend a <hi>Good Angel</hi> to him to be the Guide and Governor of his life and actions, adding alſo, That before and after Prayer he uſed to ſpend two or three hours in meditation and reading the Scriptures, diligently inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and conſidering with himſelf what Religion among thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are controverted in the world might be beſt, beſeeching God that he would pleaſe to direct him to it, and that he did
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:153159:92"/>not allow of their way who at all adventures pray to God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in that opinion they have already imbraced be it right or wrong.</p>
               <p>While he was thus buſy with himſelf in matters of Religion he lighted on a paſſage in <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> in his Book <hi>De Sacrificus</hi> where he writes, <hi>That a good and holy man can offer no greater nor more acceptable Sacrifice to God than the oblation of himſelf;</hi> And therefore following his counſel he offered his Soul unto God; After this amongſt many other Divine Dreams and Viſions he once in his ſleep ſeemed to hear the voice of God ſaying to him, <hi>I will ſave thy Soul, I am he that before appeared unto thee;</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Spirit would knock at his door every morning about three or four a Clock, though he riſing and opening the door could ſee no body, but the Spirit perſiſted in this courſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he did riſe would thus rouze him up; This trouble and boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſneſs made him begin to conceit that it was ſome <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> which thus haunted him, and therefore he daily prayed earneſtly to God that he would be pleaſed to ſend a <hi>Good Angel</hi> to him, and often alſo ſung Pſalms, having moſt of them by heart; Therefore the Spirit afterward knocked more gently at the door, and one day diſcovered himſelf to him waking, which was the firſt time that he was aſſured by his ſences that it was he, for he often toucht and ſtirr'd a Glaſs that ſtood in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which did not a little amaze him; Two days after when he entertained a certain friend of his who was Secretary to the King, this friend was much aſtoniſht to hear the Spirit thumping on the bench hard by him, but he bid him be of good courage, there was no hurt towards him, and the better to aſſure him of it told him the truth of the whole matter.</p>
               <p>From that time, ſaith <hi>Bodinus,</hi> he did affirm that this Spirit was always with him, and by ſome ſenſible ſign did ever adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him of things; as by ſtriking his right Ear if he did any thing amiſs, if otherwiſe his left; If any body came to deceive or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent him, then his right Ear was ſtruck, but his left Ear if a good man and to good ends came to viſit him; If he was about to eat or drink any thing that would hurt him, or intended or purpoſed with himſelf to do any thing that would prove ill, he was then forbid by a ſign, and if he delayed to follow his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he was quickened by a ſign given him; When he began to praiſe God in Pſalms and to declare his wonderful Acts, he was preſently raiſed and ſtrengthned with a Spiritual and Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power; He dayly begged of God that he would teach him his Will, his Law, and his Truth, and ſet one day in the week apart for reading the Scripture, Meditation, and ſinging of Pſalms, and did not ſtir out of his houſe that day; Yet in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary converſation he was ſufficiently merry and of a chearful mind, and cited that ſaying for it; <hi>I ſaw the faces of the Sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:153159:93"/>joyful and merry;</hi> But in his converſing with others if he talked vainly or indiſcreetly, or had for ſome days together neglected his Devotions, he was forthwith admoniſhed thereof in a Dream; He was likewiſe admoniſht to riſe early in the morning, and about four a Clock a voice would come to him while he was aſleep, ſaying, <hi>Who gets up firſt to prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He told <hi>Bodinus</hi> alſo that he was oft admoniſhed to give Alms, and that he obſerved the more charitable he was, the more proſperous he was; And that one time when his enemies ſought to take away his life, and knew he was to go by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that his Father in a Dream brought him two Horſes, one white, and the other bay, and that thereupon he bid his Servant hire him two Horſes, and though he told him nothing of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, yet he brought him a white one and a bay; In all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, Journeyings, and what other enterprizes foever he was ingaged in, he conſtantly uſed to ask counſel of God, and that one night when he had begged his bleſſing, while he ſlept he ſaw a Viſion wherein his Father ſeemed to bleſs him; Another time when he was in very great danger, and was newly gone to bed, he ſaid that the Spirit would not let him alone till he had raiſed him again, therefore he watcht and prayed all that night; The day after he eſcaped the hands of his Perſecutors in a wonderful manner, which being done, in his next ſleep he beard a voice ſaying, now ſing, <hi>He that ſits in the Tabernacle of the moſt High need never be afraid, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THis laſt Narrative is ſo extraordinary remarkable that it may well ſeem plainly beyond the power of Human Wit or the Laws of Modeſty to determine any thing therein, though it cannot but amuſe a man's mind to think what theſe Officious Spirits ſhould be that ſo willingly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times offer themſelves to aſſociate and aſſiſt mankind, whether they be Angels that are uncapable of aſſuming humane ſhapes, and therefore are ſeldom viſible, or whether they are the Souls of the deceaſed who have more affinity with Mortality and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty than the other and ſo are more ſenſible of our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and infirmities having once felt them themſelves, which is a reaſon alledged by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Bleſſed Saviour, who ſays, <hi>For verily be took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like his Brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Prieſt; For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he is able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted; For we have not an High Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, Heb.</hi> 2.16, 17. and 4.15. For ſeparate Souls being in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not unlike the Angels themſelves, it is eaſie to conceive that they may very well undergo the like Offices.</p>
               <p>It may likewiſe be worth inquiring whether every man have his Guardian Angel or <hi>Genius,</hi> or no; That Witches have many (ſuch as they are) their own confeſſions preceding do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtifie; Some Philoſophers were of opinion that every man had two <hi>Genii,</hi> a good one and a bad; Which <hi>Mahomet</hi> has taken into his Religion, affirming, that they ſit on mens ſhoulders with Table-books in their hands, and that one writes down all the good and the other all the evil that a man does; But theſe expreſſions ſeem rather Figurative than natural and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more reaſonable that a man changing the frame of his mind and his courſe of life changes his <hi>Genius</hi> withall, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that unleſs a man be very ſincere and ſingle hearted he is left<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:153159:94"/>interpoſes or offers himſelf a perpetual aſſiſtant in his affairs and fortunes. But extream Poverty, irkſom Old Age, want of Friends, the contempt, injury, and hard-heartedneſs of ill Neighbours working upon a Soul low ſunk into the body and wholly void of the Divine Life, does ſometimes kindle ſo ſharp, ſo eager, and ſo piercing a deſire of ſatisfaction and revenge that the ſhrieks of men when they are a murthering, the howling of a Wolf in the Fields in the night, or the ſqueeking and roaring of tortured Beaſts do not ſo certainly bring thoſe of their own kind to their aid, as this powerful Magick of a penſive and complaining Soul in the bitterneſs of its affliction, attracts the help of thoſe evil over-officious Spirits, of which there are ſeveral pregnant inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the foregoing Relations; So that it is probable that they are oft the forwardeſt to hang Witches who firſt made them ſo by their cruelty and uncharitableneſs, and it may be have no more goodneſs nor true piety than theſe they ſo willingly proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, but are as wicked as they, though with better luck or more diſcretion, offending no further than the Law will permit them, and therefore they ſecurely let the poor man or woman ſtarve for want of relief, though with a great deal of clamour of Juſtice they will revenge the death of their Hog or Cow.</p>
               <p>We may further inquire, why Spirits ſo ſeldom now-a-days appear, eſpecially thoſe that are good; Whether it be not the wickedneſs of the preſent age, as we have ſaid, or the general prejudice men have againſt all Spirits that appear, which they ſtraightway declare to be Devils; Or whether it ariſe from the frailty of humane Nature that is not uſually able to bear the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Spirit no more than other Animals are, for into what Agonies Horſes and Dogs are caſt upon their approach we have already heard, and is in every ones mouth, and may be a good circumſtance to diſtinguiſh a real Apparition from our own fancies and imaginations which theſe Creatures are not capable of; Or laſtly, whether it be the condition of Spirits themſelves, who it may be without ſome violence done to their own natures cannot become viſible, it happily being as troubleſome to them to continue viſible for ſome time as it is for men that dive to hold their breath in the water; yet it does not follow from hence that there are no ſuch Appearances though ſome it may be will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it becauſe they themſelves never ſaw any, for that can be no evidence that they are not extant in nature, ſince every man hath a reaſonable Soul in himſelf which is an immortal living Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and yet none ever ſaw it forſaking its Habitation and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body, for as long as we are in this mortal Body we can naturally ſee nothing but what is corporeal, nay our eyes are ſo weak that we cannot diſcern many real ſubſtances without the help of an Inſtrument invented for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To confirm this truth of Apparitions if we will but admit the
